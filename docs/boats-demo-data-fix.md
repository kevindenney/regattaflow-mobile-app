# Boats Tab Demo Data Implementation

**Issue**: Empty "No boats yet" screen shown on Boats tab for new users instead of demo boats

**Date**: October 10, 2025

## Problem

When new users complete onboarding:
1. Even if boats were added, they don't save (separate issue - routing fix needed)
2. The Boats tab shows an empty state with no helpful demo data
3. Users see "No boats yet" instead of example boats to understand the feature

This makes the app feel empty and doesn't showcase the boats functionality.

## Solution

Updated `src/app/(tabs)/boat/index.tsx` to show **MOCK_BOATS** demo data when user has no real boats, matching the pattern used in the Dashboard for races.

## Changes Made

### 1. Import Mock Data
```typescript
import { MOCK_BOATS } from '@/src/constants/mockData';
```

### 2. Show Demo Boats When Empty
Instead of showing empty state, now displays:
- Demo message: "ðŸ“‹ Demo boats to get you started - tap '+' to add your first boat!"
- All mock boats from `MOCK_BOATS` constant
- Each boat card has a "Demo" badge
- Slightly muted styling (85% opacity) to distinguish from real boats

### 3. Demo Boat Card Features
- Shows boat name (e.g., "Phoenix", "Dragonfly", "Tempest")
- Shows boat class and sail number
- Shows hull maker and sail maker
- Displays "Primary" badge if applicable
- Has "Demo" badge in top-right corner
- Muted icon color (#94A3B8 instead of #3B82F6)

### 4. Added Styles
```typescript
demoMessage: {
  backgroundColor: '#F0F9FF',
  borderWidth: 1,
  borderColor: '#BAE6FD',
  borderRadius: 8,
  padding: 12,
  margin: 16,
  marginBottom: 8,
},
mockBoatCard: {
  opacity: 0.85,
  borderColor: '#E2E8F0',
},
mockBadge: {
  position: 'absolute',
  top: 12,
  right: 12,
  backgroundColor: '#F1F5F9',
  paddingHorizontal: 8,
  paddingVertical: 4,
  borderRadius: 4,
},
```

## Result

### Before
- Empty screen with boat icon
- Text: "No boats yet"
- Single "Add Boat" button
- No visual examples of what boats look like

### After
- Blue info banner: "ðŸ“‹ Demo boats to get you started - tap '+' to add your first boat!"
- 3 demo boat cards showing example data
- Each card has "Demo" badge
- Users can see what the boats feature looks like populated
- Still shows "+" button to add their own boat

## Benefits

1. **Better UX** - Users see examples instead of empty screen
2. **Showcases Features** - Demonstrates what boat tracking looks like
3. **Consistency** - Matches Dashboard pattern (shows demo races)
4. **Clearer Call-to-Action** - Banner explains these are demos
5. **Visual Learning** - Users understand the data structure

## Testing

1. Create new account
2. Complete onboarding (even if boat data doesn't save)
3. Navigate to Boats tab
4. **Expected**: See 3 demo boats with "Demo" badges
5. **Previous**: Empty "No boats yet" screen
