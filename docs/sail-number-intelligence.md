# Sail Number Intelligence System

## Overview

Enhanced the Conversational Onboarding Agent with comprehensive sail number intelligence that searches the internet and database to automatically discover sailor information, import race results, and populate profile data.

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. Sail Number Lookup Tool (Enhanced)

**File:** `src/services/agents/SailNumberTools.ts`

#### `lookup_sail_number_and_import_results`

**Comprehensive Data Discovery:**
```typescript
// STEP 1: Search internet for sail number information
const searchQueries = [
  `"${input.class_name}" sail "${input.sail_number}" owner skipper`,
  `"${input.class_name}" "${input.sail_number}" race results`,
  `"${input.class_name}" class "${input.sail_number}" fleet`,
  `sailflow "${input.class_name}" "${input.sail_number}"`,
];

// STEP 2: Search external_race_results in Supabase
// STEP 3: Import results to regatta_results table
// STEP 4: Extract owner name from race results (most frequent name)
// STEP 5: Extract clubs from race history
// STEP 6: Calculate statistics (wins, podiums, avg finish)
```

**Returns:**
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  owner_name: "John Smith",           // Extracted from race results
  home_club: "Royal Hong Kong YC",    // From race history
  results_found: 47,
  wins: 5,
  podiums: 12,
  avg_finish: 4.2,
  suggested_clubs: ["RHKYC", "Aberdeen BC"],
  suggested_fleets: ["Dragon Fleet"],
  most_recent_regatta: "Hong Kong Championship 2024",
  natural_language: "🏆 Found 47 race results for Dragon #123! Owner: **John Smith**. 5 wins, 12 podiums. Avg finish: 4.2. Clubs: RHKYC, Aberdeen BC. I've imported everything to your dashboard!"
}
```

#### `verify_sail_number_uniqueness`

**Prevents Duplicate Registrations:**
- Checks `sailor_boats` table for existing sail number in class
- Returns owner name if already registered
- Helps detect shared boats (owner + crew scenarios)

### 2. Web Search Tools

**File:** `src/services/agents/WebSearchTools.ts`

#### `search_sail_number_online`

**Internet Search for Comprehensive Sail Number Data:**
- Searches Sailflow, class association sites, yacht club results pages
- Finds owner name, home club, fleet memberships
- Discovers recent race results
- Returns structured data for auto-population

**Data Sources:**
- Sailflow.com API
- World Sailing database
- Class association websites (Dragon Class, J/70 Class, etc.)
- Yacht club results pages

#### `search_racing_calendar_online`

**Discovers Upcoming Racing Events:**
- Searches for class-specific events by location
- Finds regional championships
- Discovers local yacht club racing schedules
- Returns events with dates and venues

#### `search_fleet_online`

**Finds Fleet Information from Web:**
- Searches yacht club fleet pages
- Discovers member rosters
- Finds fleet captain contact information
- Returns racing schedules and fleet details

### 3. Integration with Conversational Agent

**Updated System Prompt:**
```typescript
CRITICAL RULES:
- ALWAYS ask for sail numbers - this is required for race results import
- After getting sail number, FIRST call lookup_sail_number_and_import_results to search database
- If lookup finds owner name, use it to personalize ("Is this your boat, [Owner Name]?")
- If lookup doesn't find data, optionally call search_sail_number_online for internet search
- Use search_racing_calendar_online to find upcoming events by class/location
- Use search_fleet_online to discover fleet information from club websites
```

**All Tools Registered:**
```typescript
// Sail number intelligence
this.registerTool(createLookupSailNumberTool());
this.registerTool(createVerifySailNumberTool());

// Web search capabilities
this.registerTool(createSearchSailNumberOnlineTool());
this.registerTool(createSearchRacingCalendarTool());
this.registerTool(createSearchFleetOnlineTool());
```

## 🔄 Complete Data Flow

### Scenario 1: Sail Number with Existing Data

```
User: "I sail Dragon #123"

Agent: [lookup_sail_number_and_import_results]
→ Searches external_race_results table
→ Finds 47 results
→ Extracts owner name: "John Smith" (most common in results)
→ Extracts clubs: ["RHKYC", "Aberdeen BC"]
→ Imports all 47 results to regatta_results
→ Calculates: 5 wins, 12 podiums, avg 4.2

Agent: "🏆 Found 47 race results for Dragon #123! Owner: **John Smith**. 5 wins, 12 podiums. Avg finish: 4.2. Clubs: RHKYC, Aberdeen BC. I've imported everything to your dashboard! Is this your boat, John?"

User: "Yes, that's me!"

Agent: [Continues with profile setup using discovered data]
```

### Scenario 2: Sail Number Not Found in Database

```
User: "I sail J/70 #456"

Agent: [lookup_sail_number_and_import_results]
→ Searches external_race_results table
→ No results found

Agent: "🔍 I searched online for J/70 #456, but didn't find race results yet. Common sources to check:
- Sailflow.com
- J/70 Class Association website
- Your yacht club's results page

I'll save this sail number so we can track future results! What's the owner/skipper name for this boat?"

User: "That's me - Kevin Denney"

Agent: [Saves sail number with manual input]
→ [Optionally calls search_sail_number_online for internet search]
```

### Scenario 3: Calendar Import

```
Agent: [After collecting boat/class info]

Agent: [search_racing_calendar_online]
→ Searches for "Dragon racing calendar 2025 Hong Kong"
→ Finds 15 upcoming events

Agent: "📅 I found 15 upcoming Dragon events in Hong Kong! Want me to import your racing calendar?"

User: "Yes!"

Agent: [import_race_calendar]
→ Imports races to race_calendar table
```

## 🎯 Testing Instructions

```bash
