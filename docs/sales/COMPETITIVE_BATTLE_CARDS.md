# Battle Card 1: vs SAILTI

## Competitor Overview

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Company** | SAILTI (sailti.com) |
| **HQ** | Spain |
| **Founded** | ~2010 |
| **Primary Market** | Spanish-speaking countries, international classes |
| **Key Clients** | RFEV, RYA, FFVoile, 470 Class, IODA, iQFoil |

## Their Strengths

✅ Established federation relationships  
✅ Complete suite (Scoring, Jury, Race Signals, Web)  
✅ Proven at major international championships  
✅ Multi-language support  
✅ Strong in Olympic classes  

## Their Weaknesses

❌ No AI features (race strategy, coaching)  
❌ Aging technology stack  
❌ Mobile experience is web-based, not native  
❌ Limited offline capability  
❌ Spanish-centric support  
❌ No Sailwave integration  
❌ No 3D visualization or tactical maps  

## Our Advantages

| Feature | SAILTI | RegattaFlow |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| AI Race Strategy | ❌ None | ✅ 15+ Claude skills |
| AI Coaching | ❌ None | ✅ Post-race analysis |
| 3D Bathymetry | ❌ None | ✅ Interactive maps |
| Mobile App | Web-based | ✅ Native iOS/Android |
| Offline Mode | Limited | ✅ Full offline-first |
| Sailwave Integration | Basic export | ✅ Full import/export |
| Weather Intelligence | Basic | ✅ StormGlass + AI |

## Key Differentiator Message

> "SAILTI is great for running the operational side of a regatta. RegattaFlow does that AND gives your sailors something SAILTI can't - personalized AI race strategy and coaching. We're not just race management; we're sailing intelligence."

## Competitive Positioning

```
"SAILTI manages your regatta. 
RegattaFlow makes your sailors faster."
```

## When You'll Win

✅ Prospect values AI/innovation  
✅ Sailors are key stakeholders (not just race committee)  
✅ Mobile experience is a priority  
✅ They want Sailwave compatibility  
✅ Non-Spanish speaking organization  
✅ Looking for a modern, API-first platform  

## When You'll Lose

❌ Deep existing SAILTI relationship  
❌ Spanish federation (SAILTI home market)  
❌ Need World Sailing certification (they have it, we don't yet)  
❌ Very large event with no tolerance for new platform risk  

## Objection Handling

**"We've used SAILTI for years and it works"**
> "That makes sense - they've been around a long time. What we hear from classes who've tried both is that SAILTI handles the operations well, but their sailors love what RegattaFlow adds on top - the AI strategy, the native app experience, the tactical insights. Many use both: SAILTI for scoring, RegattaFlow for the sailor experience."

**"SAILTI has federation relationships"**
> "They do, and we respect that. Our approach is different - we work with classes and clubs first, prove value, then expand. We're not asking you to replace SAILTI overnight. Start with a pilot, see what your sailors think."

**"Can you handle [major championship]?"**
> "We're focused on getting it right before going big. We'd rather do an amazing job at a mid-size event than stumble at a worlds. Let's prove ourselves at [smaller event] first."

## Trap Questions to Ask

- "How do your sailors prepare for races currently?"
- "What do competitors say about the mobile experience?"
- "Do you offer any coaching or learning tools?"
- "How do clubs that use Sailwave integrate with your system?"

# Battle Card 2: vs Sailwave

## Competitor Overview

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Software** | Sailwave (sailwave.com) |
| **Type** | Desktop application (Windows) |
| **Cost** | Free (donationware) |
| **Market Share** | Dominant at club level worldwide |
| **Developer** | Colin Jenkins (UK) |

## Their Strengths

✅ **Free** - hard to compete on price  
✅ Incredibly powerful scoring engine  
✅ Industry standard file format (.BLW)  
✅ Huge install base and familiarity  
✅ Handles complex scoring scenarios  
✅ Active development and support forums  

## Their Weaknesses

❌ Desktop-only (Windows)  
❌ No mobile app  
❌ No online registration  
❌ No real-time results for spectators  
❌ Dated user interface  
❌ No AI or intelligence features  
❌ No competitor/sailor features  
❌ Manual result publishing workflow  

## Our Position: Complement, Not Compete

**Critical**: We do NOT position against Sailwave. We position as the **companion** that adds what Sailwave lacks.

## Key Message

> "Keep using Sailwave - it's great at scoring. Use RegattaFlow for everything else: mobile apps, online registration, live results, AI coaching. Import and export .BLW files seamlessly."

## Integration Pitch

```
Sailwave (Scoring) + RegattaFlow (Everything Else) = Complete Solution

- Race Committee: Score in Sailwave as usual
- Export results to RegattaFlow with one click
- Competitors get: Mobile app, push notifications, AI strategy
- Spectators get: Live results, standings, updates
```

## Feature Comparison (Positioning as Complementary)

| Capability | Sailwave | RegattaFlow | Together |
|------------|----------|-------------|----------|
| Scoring Engine | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Good | Use Sailwave |
| Mobile App | ❌ None | ✅ Native | RegattaFlow |
| Online Registration | ❌ None | ✅ Yes | RegattaFlow |
| Live Results | ❌ None | ✅ Yes | RegattaFlow |
| AI Strategy | ❌ None | ✅ Yes | RegattaFlow |
| Offline Desktop | ✅ Yes | ❌ Web/Mobile | Sailwave |
| Complex Handicaps | ✅ Excellent | 🟡 Basic | Use Sailwave |

## When to Use This Card

- Prospect says "our clubs use Sailwave"
- Race officers are resistant to change
- There's no budget for new tools
- Club-level organizations

## Objection Handling

**"Our race officers won't change from Sailwave"**
> "They don't have to! That's the beauty of our approach. Race officers continue using Sailwave exactly as they do now. They export a .BLW file, import to RegattaFlow, and suddenly competitors have a mobile app with live results and AI coaching. Zero change to the race officer workflow."

**"Sailwave is free"**
> "Sailwave is fantastic value - we encourage clubs to keep using it for scoring. RegattaFlow adds the mobile and AI layer. Our club tier is €500/year, which gets you online registration, native apps, and features Sailwave simply can't offer as a desktop tool."

**"We don't need another system"**
> "I hear you. Think of us as an extension of Sailwave, not a replacement. Your race officers keep their workflow. Your competitors get a 21st-century experience. One .BLW import and you're connected."

## Partnership Opportunity

Consider reaching out to Colin Jenkins (Sailwave developer) about:
- Official "companion app" status
- Listing on Sailwave Third Party Resources page
- Joint promotion to Sailwave user base

## When You'll Win

✅ They want more than just registration

**"World Sailing events use Manage2Sail"**
> "They use it for registration, yes. But many events then use separate tools for scoring, results, and communication. RegattaFlow brings all of that together, plus AI features no one else offers."

# Battle Card 5: vs "Do Nothing" / Status Quo

## The Real Competitor

Often, the biggest competitor isn't another platform - it's inertia. "We've always done it this way."

## Status Quo Components

- **Sailwave** for scoring (desktop)
- **Email** for notices and communication
- **Club website** for results posting
- **WhatsApp groups** for updates
- **Spreadsheets** for registration

## Pain Points of Status Quo

| Pain | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Manual result uploads | Race officer time wasted |
| No push notifications | Competitors miss updates |
| Fragmented communication | Confusion, missed notices |
| No mobile experience | Poor competitor satisfaction |
| No AI coaching | Missed learning opportunity |
| No spectator engagement | Lower event profile |

## Our Value Proposition

> "You can keep doing what you're doing. But your competitors expect more - they have live scores for football, why not sailing? Your race officers deserve less admin work. Your sailors deserve AI coaching. And you deserve a platform that just works."

## ROI Arguments

**For Race Officers:**
- Automated result publishing saves 2+ hours per event
- Push notifications eliminate "did they see it?" anxiety
- Sailwave integration means no workflow change

**For Competitors:**
- AI race strategy (unique value)
- Mobile app with offline (reliability)
- Live results (engagement)

**For Class/Club:**
- Professional image
- Competitor satisfaction
- Data and analytics
- Sponsor visibility

## Key Questions to Surface Pain

- "How long does it take to publish results after each race?"
- "How do competitors find out about schedule changes?"
- "What do your sailors use to prepare for races?"
- "How do spectators follow the racing?"
- "What feedback do you get from competitors about the technology experience?"

# Battle Card 6: vs Custom/DIY Solutions

## The Competitor

Some organizations build their own solutions:
- Custom websites
- Bespoke apps
- Integrated WordPress plugins
- Developer-maintained systems

## Why They Built Custom

- "Commercial solutions didn't fit"
- "We have technical volunteers"
- "We wanted control"
- "Cost seemed lower"

## Hidden Costs of DIY

| Cost | Often Overlooked |
|------|------------------|
| Maintenance | Ongoing developer time |
| Updates | OS changes, security patches |
| Mobile | Expensive to maintain two platforms |
| Features | Each new feature = development |
| Support | Who helps when it breaks? |
| Scaling | Can it handle growth? |

## Our Value Proposition

> "Building your own made sense when commercial options didn't exist. Now you're spending volunteer time maintaining software instead of running sailing. Let us handle the technology; you focus on the sport."

## Key Questions

- "How much time does your technical team spend on maintenance?"
- "What happens if your developer volunteer moves away?"
- "When did you last add a significant new feature?"
- "Could you add AI coaching to your system?"

## Migration Path

We offer free data migration from custom systems:
1. Export competitor history
2. Map data to RegattaFlow schema
3. Import and verify
4. Run parallel for one event
5. Full cutover
