# Class Association Outreach Templates

**Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: December 8, 2025  
**Purpose**: Email templates for European class association partnerships

---

## Overview

These templates are designed for outreach to international one-design class associations that run events across Europe. The goal is to secure pilot partnerships where we provide full platform access in exchange for feedback and case studies.

---

## Template 1: Dragon Class (Warm Lead - Existing Relationship)

**Subject**: Expanding our partnership - Full RegattaFlow platform for Dragon Europeans?

---

Hi [Name],

I hope you're well! It's been great working with you on the Dragon Class branding project.

I wanted to reach out because we've been building something I think would be perfect for the Dragon Class - and I'd love your feedback.

**We've developed a complete regatta management platform** that goes beyond what we've done together so far. Here's what's new:

📱 **Native mobile apps** - Competitors get push notifications, live results, and AI race strategy
🌊 **3D venue maps** - Interactive bathymetry and tactical overlays for every venue
🤖 **AI coaching** - Personalized race strategy and post-race analysis
📊 **Full scoring** - Complete scoring engine with Sailwave import/export

**What we're proposing:**

We'd like to offer the Dragon Class **free platform access for all 2025 European events** as a pilot program. In return, we'd ask for:
- Feedback to shape the product
- Permission to create a case study
- Introduction to other classes if it works well

The timing works well - we could be ready for [specific upcoming event].

Would you have 20 minutes this week or next to discuss? I can show you a demo and walk through how it would work.

Best regards,

[Your name]  
RegattaFlow

## Template 2: J/70 European Class (Cold Outreach)

**Subject**: One platform for all J/70 European events?

---

Dear [Name / J/70 European Class Association],

I'm reaching out because the J/70 class runs one of the most active European circuits - and I believe we can help make it even better for your competitors.

**The challenge we've heard from class associations:**
- Different clubs use different systems (Sailwave, spreadsheets, custom websites)
- Competitors never know where to find results, schedules, or notices
- No unified mobile experience across events

**What RegattaFlow offers:**

We've built a modern, mobile-first regatta platform specifically for sailing. What makes us different:

1. **Sailwave Compatible** - Import/export .BLW files. Clubs keep their scoring workflow.
2. **AI Race Strategy** - Give your competitors personalized tactical analysis (no one else has this)
3. **Native Mobile Apps** - Real push notifications, offline access, live results
4. **Custom Branding** - "J/70 Europeans 2025" app with your branding

**Our proposal:**

We'd like to partner with J/70 Europe for a **free pilot at one event** in 2025. We'll provide:
- Full platform access
- On-site support
- Custom-branded competitor app
- AI race strategy for all registered sailors

In return, we ask for:
- Honest feedback
- Permission for a case study
- Consideration for a longer partnership if successful

**Why now?**

We're specifically focused on European sailing and are investing heavily in features European classes need. Early partners get significant influence on our roadmap.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call to explore this? I can show you the platform and discuss timing for a pilot.

## Template 3: Melges 24 European Sailing Series (Cold Outreach)

**Subject**: AI-powered race strategy for Melges 24 sailors?

---

Dear [Name / Melges 24 European Series],

I'll keep this brief - I know you're busy running one of the best one-design circuits in Europe.

**One question:** Would your sailors value personalized AI race strategy before each regatta?

We've built something new at RegattaFlow - an AI system that generates tactical briefs for sailors based on:
- Venue-specific data (bathymetry, currents, typical wind patterns)
- Real-time weather forecasts
- Tidal timing
- Their own historical performance

**Here's an example output:** [link to sample strategy]

Beyond AI, we offer a complete regatta platform with mobile apps, live results, and full Sailwave integration.

**What we're proposing:**

Free pilot at one Melges 24 European event in 2025. We handle everything. If it works, we talk about a longer partnership.

Interested in learning more? I can send details or jump on a quick call.

Best,

[Your name]  
RegattaFlow

## Template 4: SB20 Class (Cold Outreach - Growth Focus)

**Subject**: Supporting SB20's growth with better race technology

---

Dear [Name / SB20 Class Association],

I've been following the SB20 class's growth in Europe - it's exciting to see a class building such strong momentum.

As you scale, I imagine the operational side gets more complex: more events, more countries, more competitors expecting a professional experience.

**That's exactly what we've built RegattaFlow for.**

We're a modern regatta platform designed for international class racing:

✅ **Unified Experience** - One app for all SB20 events across Europe  
✅ **Works with Sailwave** - No change to how clubs score races  
✅ **Mobile-First** - Native iOS/Android with offline support  
✅ **AI Features** - Race strategy and coaching no competitor has seen before  
✅ **Multi-Language** - German, French, Italian, Spanish, English  

**Why talk to us now?**

We're actively building our European presence and looking for class partners who want to shape what we build. Early partners get:
- Significant input on features
- Free pilot programs
- Priority support
- Favorable long-term pricing

I'd love to show you what we've built. Would you have 15-20 minutes in the coming weeks?

Best regards,

[Your name]

## Template 5: Federation Introduction Request

**Subject**: Introduction to [Federation] racing department?

---

Hi [Class Contact],

Thank you again for [pilot event / conversation / partnership].

As we discussed, we're looking to expand our presence in [Country]. Would you be comfortable introducing me to your contact at [Federation]?

Specifically, I'd love to connect with whoever handles:
- Racing technology and systems
- National championship organization
- Club support programs

I've drafted a brief intro below that you could forward if easier:

---

*Hi [Federation Contact],*

*[Class Contact] suggested I reach out. I'm [Your name] from RegattaFlow - we've been working with [Class] on their European events.*

*We've built a modern regatta management platform with AI features that I think could benefit [Federation] clubs and events. [Class Contact] thought you might be interested in learning more.*

*Would you have time for a brief call in the coming weeks?*

*Best, [Your name]*

No pressure at all - only if you think it's a good fit. Let me know if you'd like me to adjust anything.

Thanks again,

## Template 6: Follow-Up After No Response (7 Days)

**Subject**: Re: [Original Subject] - quick follow-up

---

Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up on my email from last week about partnering with [Class] on RegattaFlow.

I know this time of year is busy with planning for the upcoming season. If the timing isn't right, no problem at all - but I wanted to make sure my email didn't get lost.

The offer stands: **free pilot at one 2025 event**, with full platform access and on-site support.

Would a 15-minute call work sometime in the next couple weeks? I'm flexible on timing.

Best,

[Your name]

P.S. Here's a 90-second demo of our AI race strategy feature if that's helpful: [link]

## Template 7: Follow-Up After No Response (14 Days)

**Subject**: Last note on RegattaFlow partnership

---

Hi [Name],

I'll keep this short - I know my inbox would be overflowing if I were running a class association!

I reached out a couple weeks ago about a potential partnership between [Class] and RegattaFlow. I haven't heard back, so I'll assume the timing isn't right.

If circumstances change and you'd like to explore this later, I'm always happy to chat. In the meantime, I'll step back and not fill your inbox.

Wishing you a great 2025 season!

Best,

[Your name]  
RegattaFlow

## Template 8: Post-Demo Follow-Up

**Subject**: Thanks for your time - next steps for [Class] pilot

---

Hi [Name],

Thanks so much for taking the time to see the RegattaFlow demo today. It was great to hear about [specific thing they mentioned] and how [Class] is thinking about technology.

As we discussed, here's what a pilot partnership would look like:

**What we provide:**
- Full platform access for [Event Name]
- Custom-branded mobile app ("[Class] [Event] 2025")
- AI race strategy for all registered competitors
- On-site technical support
- Sailwave import/export for seamless scoring

**What we ask:**
- Honest feedback (good and bad)
- Permission to create a case study
- Brief testimonial if it goes well
- Introduction to other classes if appropriate

**Timeline:**
- [Date]: Confirm partnership
- [Date - 4 weeks before event]: App branding finalized
- [Date - 2 weeks before event]: Competitor invites sent
- [Event dates]: Full support
- [Date + 1 week]: Debrief call

**Next step:** If this looks good, I'll draft a simple letter of intent for us both to sign. Nothing legally binding - just documenting what we've agreed.

Any questions, just let me know. Looking forward to working together!

Best,

[Your name]

## Template 9: Confirmation/LOI Follow-Up

**Subject**: [Class] x RegattaFlow - Letter of Intent

Hi [Name],

Great news - I've drafted the Letter of Intent for our pilot partnership. See attached.

It covers:
- What we're each committing to
- Timeline and event details
- Contact information
- Simple sign-off (digital signature fine)

This isn't a legal contract - just a mutual understanding document. If anything looks off, let me know and we can adjust.

Once signed, I'll:
1. Set up your admin account
2. Schedule a call to configure branding
3. Begin competitor import/setup

Excited to get started!

Best,

[Your name]

## Key Messaging Points

### What Makes Us Different

1. **AI Race Strategy** - "Personalized tactical analysis for every sailor - no one else offers this"
2. **Sailwave Integration** - "Works with your existing workflow - import/export .BLW files"
3. **Mobile-First** - "Native apps, not mobile websites - real push notifications, offline support"
4. **European Focus** - "Built for European sailing - multi-language, GDPR compliant, EU data"

### Handling Objections

**"We already use Sailwave"**
> "Great - so do thousands of clubs. RegattaFlow works WITH Sailwave. Import your .BLW files, add our mobile experience and AI features, export back to Sailwave anytime."

**"We don't have budget"**
> "The pilot is completely free. We're investing in European partnerships and want to prove value before asking for any commitment."

**"Our clubs won't change"**
> "They don't have to. Race committees can use Sailwave exactly as before. We add the competitor experience layer on top - mobile app, live results, AI coaching."

**"We tried something similar before"**
> "What didn't work? We're actively building based on class feedback - if there's a gap, tell us and we'll prioritize it."

**"We need to discuss with the board"**
> "Of course. Would it help if I prepared a one-page summary for the board? Or I'm happy to present directly if that's useful."
