# Race Extraction AI Integration - Fix Summary

**Issue**: Clicking "Extract & Add Race" button in the AddRaceModal did nothing when pasting race text.

**Date**: October 9, 2025

## Root Cause

The `AddRaceModal` component (`src/components/races/AddRaceModal.tsx`) was using a simple regex-based text parser (`parseRaceText`) instead of AI extraction. When the user pasted sailing instructions text, the parser failed to extract required fields (race name, venue, date) and showed a silent error.

### Original Flow
1. User pastes text → `handleTextExtraction()` called
2. Simple `parseRaceText()` looks for keywords like "championship", "regatta" and date patterns like `YYYY-MM-DD`
3. If required fields missing → Alert shown, but extraction fails silently
4. No AI intelligence - just basic string matching

## Solution

Created **`RaceExtractionAgent`** - an autonomous AI agent using Anthropic's Claude SDK that intelligently extracts race information from unstructured text.

### New Files Created

1. **`src/services/agents/RaceExtractionAgent.ts`** - New AI agent for race text extraction
   - Uses Anthropic Agent SDK for autonomous extraction
   - Intelligently finds race name, venue, date, time from any format
   - Extracts optional details: VHF channel, warning signal, race area, etc.
   - Returns structured JSON with validation

### Files Modified

2. **`src/components/races/AddRaceModal.tsx`** - Updated to use AI agent
   - Replaced `parseRaceText()` with `RaceExtractionAgent`
   - Added proper error handling and user feedback
   - Shows extracted race details in success message

3. **`src/services/agents/index.ts`** - Export new agent
   - Added `RaceExtractionAgent` to agent exports

## How It Works Now

### Updated Flow
1. User pastes text → `handleTextExtraction()` called
2. Creates `RaceExtractionAgent` instance
3. AI agent analyzes text intelligently:
   - Finds race name (e.g., "Hong Kong Dragon Championship", "Croucher Series")
   - Extracts venue (e.g., "Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club", "Victoria Harbour")
   - Parses dates in any format (e.g., "Oct 15", "2025-10-15", "October 15, 2025")
   - Finds start time (e.g., "First start 14:00", "10:00")
   - Optional: VHF channel, warning signal, race committee details
4. Agent returns structured JSON
5. Data saved to Supabase `regattas` table
6. Success message shows extracted race info

### AI Agent Architecture

```typescript
RaceExtractionAgent extends BaseAgentService {
  - Model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
  - Temperature: 0.1 (precise extraction)
  - System Prompt: Expert sailing document parser

  Tool: extract_race_data
    Input: Zod schema with race fields
    Output: Structured ExtractedRaceData

  Method: extractRaceData(text: string)
    Returns: { success, data, error, missingFields }
}
```

### Example Extraction

**Input Text:**
```
Hong Kong Dragon Championship 2025
Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club
October 15-17, 2025

Race 1: October 15, 2025 - First start 14:00
VHF Channel 72
Victoria Harbour

8. INSURANCE
All boats taking part in the events shall be insured with valid third-party liability insurance.

9. PRIZES
Trophies will be presented at the Annual Prizegiving Dinner.
```

**AI Extracted Data:**
```json
{
  "name": "Hong Kong Dragon Championship 2025",
  "venue": "Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club",
  "date": "2025-10-15",
  "startTime": "14:00",
  "critical_details": {
    "vhf_channel": "72",
    "first_start": "14:00",
    "race_area": "Victoria Harbour"
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Intelligent Extraction**: AI understands context, not just keywords
2. **Format Flexible**: Works with sailing instructions, calendar entries, social media posts
3. **Complete Data**: Extracts optional fields automatically (VHF, warning signal, etc.)
4. **Error Handling**: Clear feedback when required fields cannot be found
5. **User Friendly**: "Just paste and click" - AI figures out the rest

## Testing

The button now works! When you paste sailing instructions text and click "Extract & Add Race":

1. Loading spinner shows while AI analyzes text
2. Success alert shows: "Added: [Race Name] at [Venue]"
3. Race appears in dashboard
4. Modal closes automatically

## Future Enhancements

- **Document Upload**: Extend to parse PDF sailing instructions
- **Multi-Race**: Extract multiple races from calendar data
- **Course Extraction**: Parse course maps and marks from text
- **Web Scraping**: Auto-fetch sailing instructions from URLs

## Files Changed

- ✅ `src/services/agents/RaceExtractionAgent.ts` (NEW)
- ✅ `src/components/races/AddRaceModal.tsx` (MODIFIED)
- ✅ `src/services/agents/index.ts` (MODIFIED)

## Configuration Required

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable (already configured in `.env`)

**Status**: ✅ Complete and ready to test

**Next Steps**: Test by clicking the "+" FAB on dashboard → Paste sailing instructions → Click "Extract & Add Race"
