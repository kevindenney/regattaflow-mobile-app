# Enhanced Conversational Onboarding - Complete Implementation

## Overview

Successfully enhanced the conversational sailor onboarding with comprehensive Supabase integration, multiple boat support, social connections, calendar imports, and editable summaries.

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. Enhanced Onboarding Tools (Supabase-Integrated)

**File:** `src/services/agents/EnhancedOnboardingTools.ts`

#### New Tools:

1. **`find_yacht_clubs_at_venue`**
   - Queries Supabase `yacht_clubs` table by venue
   - Returns actual clubs with details
   - Natural language: "I found 3 yacht clubs: RHKYC, Aberdeen Boat Club..."

2. **`find_fleets_by_boat_class`**
   - Queries Supabase `fleets` table by class name
   - Returns fleets with member counts and club associations
   - Supports venue filtering
   - Natural language: "I found 2 Dragon fleets at this venue..."

3. **`find_sailors_in_fleet`**
   - Queries sailor profiles in specific fleets
   - Enables "Do you know..." social connection suggestions
   - Natural language: "Do you know John Smith, Jane Doe from this fleet?"

4. **`save_sailor_profile`**
   - **Master data persistence tool**
   - Saves to multiple tables:
     - `sailor_profiles` (role, primary venue)
     - `sailor_boats` (all boats with ownership status)
     - `club_members` (club memberships)
     - `fleet_members` (fleet memberships)
   - Atomic transaction with rollback support

5. **`generate_onboarding_summary`**
   - Creates formatted markdown summary
   - Shows all collected data for review
   - Prompts for confirmation or edits

6. **`import_race_calendar`**
   - Imports races from yacht clubs
   - Imports class association events
   - Populates sailor's race calendar automatically

### 2. Onboarding Summary Component

**File:** `src/components/onboarding/OnboardingSummary.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ Visual summary with color-coded sections
- ✅ **Inline editing** for all fields
- ✅ Add/remove boats dynamically
- ✅ Toggle owner/crew status per boat
- ✅ Edit sail numbers
- ✅ Confirm & Save or Edit buttons
- ✅ Mobile-optimized with Tailwind CSS

**Sections:**
- 📍 Home Venue
- 👤 Sailor Role (owner/crew/both) - **Editable**
- ⛵ Your Boats - **Add/Edit/Remove**
- 🏛️ Yacht Clubs
- 🏁 Racing Fleets

### 3. Enhanced Conversation Flow

**Updated System Prompt** includes:

1. **GPS Detection** → Venue identification
2. **Owner vs Crew** → "Are you a boat owner, crew, or both?"
3. **Primary Boat** → With venue-specific suggestions
4. **Additional Boats** → "Do you race on other boats?"
5. **Sail Numbers** → Optional for each boat
6. **Find Yacht Clubs** → Real Supabase query
7. **Find Fleets** → Real Supabase query by boat class
8. **Social Connections** → "Do you know these sailors?"
9. **Race Calendar Import** → Club + class events
10. **Generate Summary** → Full profile review
11. **Allow Edits** → User can modify anything
12. **Save Everything** → Persist to all tables

### 4. Database Migrations

**Applied via MCP Supabase:**

#### `sailor_boats` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE sailor_boats (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  sailor_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  class_id UUID REFERENCES boat_classes(id),
  sail_number TEXT,
  is_owner BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  is_primary BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

**Purpose:** Track multiple boats per sailor (owner or crew)

#### `fleet_members` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE fleet_members (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  sailor_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  fleet_id UUID REFERENCES fleets(id),
  joined_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('active', 'inactive', 'pending'))
);
```

**Purpose:** Track sailor memberships in racing fleets

**Both tables include:**
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Indexes for performance
- ✅ CASCADE deletion
- ✅ Unique constraints

## 🔄 Complete Data Flow
