# REGATTAFLOW USER EXPERIENCE AUDIT

## Executive Summary
- Overall completion: Sailor ~45%, Coach ~20%, Club ~25%
- Critical gaps: real data wiring (many mocks), AI agents not fully connected to UI, onboarding persistence, race day (timer/GPS), payments (Stripe Connect), real-time updates, CRUD coverage
- Recommended priority: 1) Sailor workflows to MVP; 2) Club event/race systems; 3) Coach marketplace

## SAILOR EXPERIENCE

### A. NAVIGATION & ROUTING
- Check: `src/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` (dynamic per `userType` via `getTabsForUserType`)

- Tabs for SAILOR (visible):
  - Dashboard (`/(tabs)/dashboard`)
  - Calendar (`/(tabs)/calendar`)
  - Courses (`/(tabs)/races`)
  - Boats (`/(tabs)/boat/index`)
  - Fleets (`/(tabs)/fleet`)
  - Clubs (`/(tabs)/club`)
  - More (Hamburger menu trigger)

- Hamburger menu items (from `menuItems`):
  - Venue (`/(tabs)/venue`)
  - Crew (`/(tabs)/crew`)
  - Tuning Guides (`/(tabs)/tuning-guides`)
  - Profile (`/(tabs)/profile`)
  - Settings (`/(tabs)/settings`)

- Hidden/aux routes available but not on tab bar (href null when not visible):
  - `/(tabs)/profile`, `/(tabs)/settings`, `/(tabs)/venue`, `/(tabs)/strategy`, `/(tabs)/map`
  - Race subroutes: `/(tabs)/race/[id]`, `/(tabs)/race/add`, `/(tabs)/race/timer`, `/(tabs)/race/course`, `/(tabs)/race/strategy`

- Additional screens outside `(tabs)` relevant to sailors (not surfaced in tabs/menu by default):
  - `src/app/ai-strategy.tsx` (AI Strategy Center)
  - `src/app/map-fullscreen.tsx`
  - `src/app/race/tactical.tsx`, `src/app/race/tactical.web.tsx`

- Notes / potential gaps:
  - AI Strategy Center and Tactical views exist but lack direct navigation entry points in the SAILOR tabs/menu.
  - Hidden routes are reachable via deep links or in-app navigation, not via the tab bar.

### B. SCREENS INVENTORY

Legend: ✅ COMPLETE, 🟡 PARTIAL, 🔴 MISSING

- Dashboard — `src/app/(tabs)/dashboard.tsx`
  - What it does: Sailor home with next race, recent race, boats, fleets, venue detection.
  - Data connections: Hook-driven via `useDashboardData` (internal); uses venue detection and offline cache. Supabase tables not directly visible here.
  - Mock vs real: Mixed; UI wired to hooks; underlying data source not shown in this file.
  - Completeness: 60-70% 🟡
  - Issues/blockers: Depends on `useDashboardData` implementation; actions (e.g., Plan Strategy) not wired to agent flows from this screen.

- Calendar — `src/app/(tabs)/calendar.tsx`
  - What it does: Month/List/Map views of races/events, event modal; integrates saved venues.
  - Data connections: `useSailorDashboardData` (regattas, documents, results) and `useSavedVenues` (saved_venues view). Uses hook outputs to build events.
  - Mock vs real: Real hook data with some TODOs (venue lat/lng).
  - Completeness: ~70% 🟡
  - Issues/blockers: TODOs for venue coordinates; actions (Get Directions, Weather) are placeholders.

- Courses — `src/app/(tabs)/races.tsx`
  - What it does: Course map, document upload, AI extraction, 3D visualization, strategy, race day, analysis (modal workflow).
  - Data connections: `useSailorDashboardData`, `useSailingDocuments`; planned `DocumentProcessingAgent` integration.
  - Mock vs real: Significant mock/placeholder for extraction and strategy; TODO to connect agent.
  - Completeness: ~60% 🟡
  - Issues/blockers: Agent integration missing; race-day timer not connected to race_timer_sessions schema.

- Boats — `src/app/(tabs)/boat/index.tsx`
  - What it does: Lists individual boats for the sailor; navigates to boat detail.
  - Data connections: `sailorBoatService.listBoatsForSailor(user.id)` (likely Supabase tables per migrations: sailor boats separation).
  - Mock vs real: Real service-backed list; add-boat flow TODO.
  - Completeness: ~70% 🟡
  - Issues/blockers: Missing add/edit boat flows; boat detail route exists (`/(tabs)/boat/[id].tsx`) but not reviewed here.

- Fleet — `src/app/(tabs)/fleet/index.tsx`
  - What it does: Fleet overview, metrics, recent activity, quick actions, join fleets link.
  - Data connections: `useUserFleets`, `useFleetOverview`, `useFleetActivity`; RLS for `fleet_members` fixed in migrations.
  - Mock vs real: Hook-driven real data; member directory is placeholder text.
  - Completeness: ~65% 🟡
  - Issues/blockers: Members/resources screens referenced but not implemented; quick actions not wired.

- Venue (Menu) — `src/app/(tabs)/venue.tsx`
  - What it does: Full-screen venue intelligence map with sidebar, layers, saved venues, AI-based venue detection.
  - Data connections: `useVenueIntelligence`, `useSavedVenues`, `VenueIntelligenceAgent`, `VenueDetectionService`.
  - Mock vs real: Real hooks + AI agent integration present; robust UI.
  - Completeness: ~75-80% 🟡
  - Issues/blockers: Confirmation flows and some services may rely on mock/fallbacks.

Additional Sailor-relevant screens (not fully reviewed yet):
- Race Tactical — `src/app/race/tactical.tsx`, `src/app/race/tactical.web.tsx` (tactical interface)
- AI Strategy Center — `src/app/ai-strategy.tsx` (upload/strategy hub)
- Boat detail — `src/app/(tabs)/boat/[id].tsx`
- Fleet subroutes — `/(tabs)/fleet/members`, `resources`, `settings` etc.

### C. CORE WORKFLOWS

1) Onboarding → Set home venue → Join fleet
- Screens: `/(auth)/persona-selection.tsx` → `/(auth)/sailor-onboarding-venue.tsx` → `/(tabs)/venue.tsx` (map) → `/(tabs)/fleet/select.tsx`.
- Data flow: `users.user_type` set via persona; saved/home venue via `saved_venues` + `sailing_venues`; fleet membership via `fleet_members`.
- Breaks/incomplete: Venue step strong; fleet join flow present but directory/members not fully implemented.
- Missing: Explicit linear sailor onboarding orchestrator (progress UI), post-onboarding completion flag update.

2) Register for race → Upload docs → AI strategy → Race day
- Screens: `/(tabs)/calendar.tsx` (add race), `/(tabs)/races.tsx` (upload/extract/visualize/strategy), `race/tactical(.web).tsx` (race mode).
- Data flow: `regattas`, `documents`, `ai_analyses`; planned `race_timer_sessions`, `race_predictions` (per migrations).
- Breaks/incomplete: DocumentProcessingAgent not wired; race timer and GPS track not connected; strategy generation mocked.
- Missing: Results push-back linking regatta→results; end-to-end status tracking; document ingestion UI outside modal.

3) Add boat → Log maintenance → Track performance
- Screens: `/(tabs)/boat/index.tsx` (list), `/(tabs)/boat/[id].tsx` (detail).
- Data flow: SailorBoatService (tables per migrations: sailor boats separation; equipment, maintenance tables implied).
- Breaks/incomplete: Add/edit boat flow TODO; maintenance UI not present; performance analytics pulled from `regatta_results` but no boat-scoped analytics UI.

### D. DATA LAYER STATUS

- Supabase tables used (observed in hooks/services):
  - `users` (profile, `user_type`) — AuthProvider, onboarding persona
  - `sailing_venues`, `saved_venues`, view `saved_venues_with_details` — Venue map and calendar
  - `boat_classes`, `sailor_classes`, `class_group_members`, `class_groups` — Sailor class context
  - `regattas`, `races` (enhanced fields) — Calendar/dashboard
  - `documents` — Uploaded SIs/NORs
  - `ai_analyses` — Strategy/analysis
  - `regatta_results` — Performance cards
  - `fleet_members` (+ related fleet tables) — Fleet overview/activity
  - Planned/race-day: `race_timer_sessions`, `ai_coach_analysis`, `coach_race_analysis`, `race_predictions`

- Screen ↔ table mapping (high-level):
  - Dashboard: `regattas`, `regatta_results`, class tables; venue via service; fleets via fleet tables
  - Calendar: `regattas`, `documents`, saved venues
  - Courses: `documents`, `ai_analyses` (planned agent extraction)
  - Boats: sailor boats tables (service)
  - Fleet: `fleet_members` + activity/resources (service)

- Missing connections:
  - Courses screen not invoking DocumentProcessingAgent → `ai_analyses`
  - Race timer screen not writing `race_timer_sessions` with GPS tracks
  - Boat add/edit not persisting to sailor boats tables from UI

- RLS status (from migrations reviewed):
  - `saved_venues`: RLS enabled; policies for CRUD by owner — Configured
  - `fleet_members`: select policies fixed to allow own membership and fleet roster for active members — Configured
  - Race tracking (`race_timer_sessions`, `ai_coach_analysis`, `coach_race_analysis`, `race_predictions`): RLS and policies defined — Configured
  - Others (e.g., `regattas`, `documents`): Not verified here

### E. AI/AGENT INTEGRATION

- Relevant agents:
  - VenueIntelligenceAgent — used in `/(tabs)/venue.tsx` for GPS-based venue detection/switching. Status: Integrated.
  - DocumentProcessingAgent — referenced in `/(tabs)/race/strategy.tsx` and `services/agents/DocumentProcessingAgent.ts`. Status: Not wired on main Courses flow; extraction mocked in `races.tsx`.
  - CoursePredictionAgent — referenced by components (course predictors) and available in `services/agents`. Status: Not surfaced in current SAILOR tabs.
  - RaceAnalysisAgent — referenced in dashboard components; tables for AI analysis exist (`ai_coach_analysis`). Status: Not connected end-to-end from race timer.
  - OnboardingAgent — referenced by discovery services for fleets/clubs. Status: Backend support present; UI flow linearization not implemented.

- UI call sites:
  - `/(tabs)/venue.tsx` calls VenueIntelligenceAgent.switchVenueByGPS → updates venue state.
  - `/(tabs)/race/strategy.tsx` imports DocumentProcessingAgent; performs `processSailingInstructions(...)` in flow. Main Courses tab still uses placeholders.

- Integration status summary: Venue intelligence is live; document processing, course prediction, and race analysis are partially integrated or planned. Race-day AI feedback loop is not yet wired into `race_timer_sessions`.

### F. SERVICES & HOOKS

- Services (relevant to SAILOR):
  - Venues: `SupabaseVenueService`, `VenueDetectionService`, `SailingNetworkService`, `GlobalVenueDatabase`.
  - Race/AI: `RaceTimerService`, `RaceStrategyEngine`, `DocumentProcessingService`, `AITacticalService`, `CoursePredictionAgent`, `RaceAnalysisAgent`.
  - Boats/Equipment: `SailorBoatService`, `equipmentAIService`.
  - Social/Fleet: `fleetService`, `FleetDiscoveryService`, `FleetSocialService`.
  - Weather/Tides: `RegionalWeatherService`, `ProfessionalWeatherService`, `WorldTidesProService`.

- Hooks (used/available):
  - `useSailorDashboardData`, `useSailingDocuments`, `useSavedVenues`, `useVenueIntelligence`, `useGlobalVenues`, `useFleetData`, `useRegionalWeather`, `useOffline`, `useFeatureAccess`.

- Screens using them:
  - Dashboard: `useDashboardData` (internal aggregate), `useVenueDetection`, `useOffline`.
  - Calendar: `useSailorDashboardData`, `useSavedVenues`.
  - Courses: `useSailorDashboardData`, `useSailingDocuments`.
  - Fleet: `useUserFleets`, `useFleetOverview`, `useFleetActivity`.

- Missing service usage:
  - Race timer not persisting via `RaceTimerService`/`race_timer_sessions`.
  - Course prediction agent not invoked from UI.
  - Equipment analytics hooks/services not surfaced in boats UI.

### G. MISSING FEATURES (vs PRD)

- Critical
  - Race day tactical interface with GPS tracking → UI present (modal), not connected to `race_timer_sessions` (Days).
  - Document processing to strategy pipeline → Agent referenced but not fully wired; needs file ingest and persistence to `ai_analyses` (Days).

- High
  - Boat maintenance/equipment tracking UI → List exists; add/edit and maintenance workflows missing (Days).
  - Results scoring import/association to enhance performance analytics → Basic `regatta_results` used; needs UI and enrichment (Days).

- Medium
  - Circuit planner deep-linking into calendar with travel heuristics (Days).
  - Weather/tide provider selection per venue (Days).

- Low
  - Share/export flows for strategies and analyses (Hours).

### H. SAILOR-SPECIFIC GAPS

- Race day tactical interface: Present as modal in Courses; not persisted nor live GPS overlays.
- GPS tracking implementation: Schema ready; needs mobile sensors integration and upload.
- Offline mode: `offlineService` and `useOffline` present; expand cached datasets (venues, races, docs) and sync flows.
- Equipment performance analytics: Hooks/services exist in parts; UI missing on boat detail.
- Fleet social features: Service present; feed/composer UI pending.
- Venue intelligence: Strong; expand layer toggles and provider-specific insights.
- Course visualization with layers: Base present; link to agent-extracted marks and alternative courses.

  - Settings (`/(tabs)/settings`)

- Hamburger menu items accessible:
  - No hamburger menu for coach (no `more` tab configured). Profile/Settings are direct tabs.

- Hidden/aux routes (href null when not in coach tab set):
  - Sailor-specific routes like `/(tabs)/races`, `/(tabs)/boat/index`, `/(tabs)/fleet`, `/(tabs)/venue`, `/(tabs)/club`, race subroutes, etc., are hidden for coach.

- Notes / potential gaps vs PRD (Coach):
  - Missing Marketplace tab (profile, bookings, optimization) — PRD calls this out.
  - Sessions tab (separate from calendar) not present; partially covered by `Schedule`.
  - Messages/inbox and Availability manager not surfaced as tabs (PRD “More” items).
  - Analytics business dashboard not a dedicated tab; might belong under Earnings/More.

## SUMMARY & RECOMMENDATIONS

### What's Working Well
1. **Architecture** - Clean separation, good service layer, hooks pattern
2. **Navigation** - Dynamic tabs work perfectly
3. **Venue Intelligence** - Best-in-class AI integration
4. **UI Components** - Professional, consistent design system
5. **Boat Management** - Solid foundation for equipment tracking
6. **Fleet Features** - Good social foundation

### Critical Gaps
1. **Data Integration** - 50%+ screens use mock data
2. **AI Agents** - Built but not connected to UI
3. **Onboarding** - UI exists but no backend persistence
4. **CRUD Operations** - Many "add" buttons go nowhere
5. **Real-time** - Supabase subscriptions not used
6. **Payment** - Stripe integration incomplete

### Immediate Actions (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Wire DocumentProcessingAgent to races screen upload modal
2. Build race registration form and payment flow
3. Connect coach onboarding forms to Supabase
4. Add boat creation modal with form
5. Wire crew management service to UI

### Strategic Recommendations
1. **Focus on Sailor First** - 45% complete vs 20% coach, 25% club
2. **Complete Workflows Over Features** - Make 1 workflow perfect vs 10 partial
3. **Leverage Existing Agents** - Wire UI to already-built AI services
4. **Real Data Priority** - Replace all mock data within 4 weeks
5. **Club Revenue Focus** - Highest revenue per user, prioritize after sailor MVP

**Estimated Timeline to MVP:**
- **Sailor MVP**: 8-10 weeks (Phases 1-2)
- **Club MVP**: 14-18 weeks (add Phase 3)
- **Full Platform**: 30-40 weeks (all phases)

---

**This is an excellent codebase with strong foundations. The main gap is wiring - connecting the UI to the already-built backend services and AI agents. The architecture supports rapid progress once data connections are established.**
