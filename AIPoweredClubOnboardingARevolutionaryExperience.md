AI-Powered Club Onboarding: A Revolutionary Experience

  Based on the existing agent architecture, here's how we could reimagine club onboarding with Anthropic Claude SDK:

  From Form-Filling to Intelligent Conversation

  Traditional Approach:
  - Multi-page form: Name → Venue → Contact → Features → Pricing
  - Static, one-size-fits-all questions
  - No context awareness
  - Manual configuration of everything

  AI-Powered Approach:
  - Conversational setup that feels like talking to an experienced sailing administrator
  - Autonomous intelligence that researches and suggests optimal configurations
  - Context-aware recommendations based on venue, region, and club type
  - Self-configuring system that learns from similar clubs

  Conversational Flow Example

  // Club admin starts onboarding
  const clubAgent = new ClubOnboardingAgent();

  // Agent: "Welcome! I'll help set up your club on RegattaFlow.
  //        Where is your club located?"

  // User: "Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club"

  // Agent internally:
  //   1. detect_venue_and_analyze_operations → Discovers:
  //      - 3 venues: Kellett Island (HQ), Middle Island (racing), Shelter Cove (marina)
  //      - Hong Kong Observatory weather integration needed
  //      - Popular classes: Dragon, Etchells, IRC, HKPN
  //      - Cultural context: Cantonese/English, HKD currency, typhoon protocols
  //
  //   2. analyze_club_type_and_recommend_setup → Determines:
  //      - Type: Premier yacht club with multi-venue operations
  //      - Events: ~200 race days/year across venues
  //      - Recommended tier: Championship ($999/mo)
  //      - Integration needs: HKPN handicaps, HKO weather

  // Agent: "Perfect! I see RHKYC operates across 3 venues. I've configured:
  //        ✓ Multi-venue management (Kellett, Middle Island, Shelter Cove)
  //        ✓ Hong Kong Observatory weather integration
  //        ✓ Dragon, Etchells, IRC, and HKPN fleet support
  //        ✓ Typhoon safety protocols
  //
  //        Your club typically runs 200+ race days annually. I recommend
  //        our Championship plan with unlimited events and multi-venue support.
  //
  //        Should I proceed with this configuration?"

  // User: "Yes, and we need to manage staff across all three locations"

  // Agent internally:
  //   3. configure_multi_venue_operations → Sets up:
  //      - Unified race calendar across venues
  //      - Cross-venue equipment and staff allocation
  //      - Inter-venue transportation coordination
  //      - Venue-specific course libraries
  //
  //   4. setup_staff_and_permissions_intelligently → Recommends:
  //      - Sailing Manager (full access)
  //      - 3x Principal Race Officers (venue-specific)
  //      - 8x Race Officers (rotating)
  //      - 12x Volunteers (timing assistance)

  // Agent: "I've set up multi-venue operations and created 4 staff role types.
  //        I recommend having a Sailing Manager with full access, PROs for
  //        each venue, and rotating race officers.
  //
  //        Would you like to invite your staff now, or configure this later?"

  // ... flow continues autonomously
