# Dragon CSV Calendar Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified

**Root Cause**: The Dragon CSV calendar file (`Dragon2526.csv`) was never being found because it's on a **separate page** from the Dragon class page.

### Website Structure Discovery

Using Chrome DevTools MCP, I investigated the RHKYC website structure:

```
Dragon Class Page
https://www.rhkyc.org.hk/sailing/classes/classes/dragon
  ❌ NO .csv files on this page
  ✅ Has "Sailing Calendar" link → /sailing/sailingcalendar

Sailing Calendar Page (where CSV files actually are)
https://www.rhkyc.org.hk/sailing/sailingcalendar
  ✅ Dragon2526.csv
  ✅ Etchells2526.csv
  ✅ J802526.csv
  ... (10+ class CSV files)
```

**The scraper was only looking at the Dragon class page and never following the "Sailing Calendar" link.**

## Solution Implemented

### New Multi-Level Scraping Logic

**File**: `src/services/agents/WebScrapingTools.ts:1272-1314`

The scraper now:
1. Detects "Sailing Calendar" links on class pages
2. Follows the link to the calendar page
3. Searches for class-specific CSV files (e.g., "Dragon" in link text or URL)
4. Downloads and parses the CSV automatically

### Expected Console Output (New Logs)

```javascript
// Step 1: Detect calendar page link
📅 [CSV DEBUG] Found sailing calendar page link: https://www.rhkyc.org.hk/sailing/sailingcalendar

// Step 2: Follow link and load page
🔗 [CSV DEBUG] Following calendar page to find CSV files: https://www.rhkyc.org.hk/sailing/sailingcalendar
📄 [CSV DEBUG] Calendar page loaded, searching for CSV links...

// Step 3: Find Dragon-specific CSV

  csvUrl: "https://www.rhkyc.org.hk/storage/app/media/Sailing/sailing%20calendar/Dragon2526.csv",
  linkText: "Dragon - updated on 19 Sept"
}

// Step 4: Auto-download CSV

// Step 6: Select next race
🏁 [NEXT RACE DEBUG] Auto-selected next race: {

}
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm start
```

### 2. Test with Dragon D59
1. Open http://localhost:8081 in Chrome
2. Open DevTools Console (F12)
3. Sign up with:
   - Boat: `Dragon D59`
   - URL: `https://www.rhkyc.org.hk/sailing/classes/classes/dragon`

### 3. Verify Console Logs
Look for these key logs:
- ✅ `📅 [CSV DEBUG] Found sailing calendar page link`
- ✅ `🔗 [CSV DEBUG] Following calendar page`
- ✅ `✅ [CSV DEBUG] Found class-specific CSV on calendar page`
- ✅ `📥 [CSV DEBUG] Downloading: ...Dragon2526.csv`
- ✅ `✅ [CSV PARSE DEBUG] Added event: Croucher 3 & 4`

### 4. Expected Results
- **Next Race**: "Croucher 3 & 4" on October 19, 2025
- **Location**: Port Shelter
- **Total Races**: 40+ (including all CSV events)
- **Series**: 5 separate entries (Croucher, Corinthian, Commodore, Moonraker, Phyloong)

## Files Modified

1. **src/services/agents/WebScrapingTools.ts**
   - Lines 1131-1141: Detect "Sailing Calendar" links
   - Lines 1272-1314: Follow calendar page and find CSV files
   - Lines 1316-1345: Auto-fetch and parse CSV

2. **TESTING-DRAGON-FIX.md** (updated with new logs)
3. **docs/dragon-series-parsing-fix.md** (updated with multi-level scraping details)

## Why This Fix Was Needed

RHKYC organizes their sailing calendars differently from other clubs:
- **Other clubs**: CSV directly on class page
- **RHKYC**: Centralized calendar page with all class CSVs

The scraper needed to be enhanced to handle this multi-level structure.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fix** - Run the signup flow and verify console logs
2. **Check CSV data** - Verify "Croucher 3 & 4" appears as next race
3. **Verify series splitting** - Confirm 5 separate series entries
4. **Report results** - Paste console logs if any issues remain

**Status**: ✅ Fix implemented and ready for testing
**Priority**: CRITICAL - This fixes the core CSV discovery issue
