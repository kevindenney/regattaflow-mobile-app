# Sound Assets

This directory contains audio files for the race committee console.

Required files:
- horn.mp3 - Horn/whistle sound for start sequences and finishes

Note: Add a suitable air horn or whistle sound effect (0.5-2 seconds).
You can find free sound effects at:
- freesound.org
- soundbible.com
- zapsplat.com

The app will fall back to vibration if the sound file is missing.
