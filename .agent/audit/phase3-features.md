# Phase 3 - Feature Integration Audit

**Date**: 2025-10-11
**Scope**: Core Features Integration Analysis

## Audit Methodology

For each feature:
- **WORKING**: Fully implemented and connected
- **PARTIALLY WIRED**: Some components exist but incomplete flow
- **NOT WIRED**: Components exist but not connected
- **NOT FOUND**: No implementation found

---

## 1. AI Features

### DocumentProcessingAgent
- [x] Agent implementation found
- [x] Upload modal connection
- [x] AI strategy screen accessible
- [x] Claude SDK configured

**Status**: ✅ WORKING

### Components Checked
- **Agent location**: `src/services/agents/DocumentProcessingAgent.ts` (439 lines, fully implemented)
- **Upload integration**: Connected in `(tabs)/race/strategy.tsx:104-126` and `(tabs)/races.tsx:23`
- **Strategy UI**: Two screens - `ai-strategy.tsx` and `race/strategy.tsx` with full workflow
- **SDK config**: Anthropic SDK installed, BaseAgentService configured, Gemini fallback active

### Integration Points Found
1. **race/strategy.tsx** - Full document upload → AI processing workflow:
   - Uses DocumentPicker for file selection
   - Calls `agent.processSailingInstructions()`
   - Shows results modal with approval flow
   - Line 105-110: Agent instantiation and processing

2. **races.tsx** - Course extraction workflow:
   - Imports DocumentProcessingAgent
   - Processes sailing documents
   - Extracts course marks for visualization

3. **Agent Tools**:
   - ✅ `extract_race_course_from_si` - Gemini-powered extraction
   - ✅ `generate_3d_course_visualization` - GeoJSON for MapLibre
   - ✅ `analyze_race_strategy` - Tactical analysis
   - ✅ `save_to_knowledge_base` - Data persistence (mocked)

### Limitations
- Knowledge base save is mocked (line 330-344 in agent)
- PDF parsing uses mock data (needs PDF library integration)
- No connection to upload-documents.tsx (basic UI, not wired to agent)

   - ✅ 2D/3D toggle, measurement tools, route simulator
   - ⚠️ Weather data is mocked (lines 145-162)
   - ⚠️ Course marks are hardcoded (lines 164-197)

3. **Race Registration**:

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Race Creation Not Persisted** ⚠️
   - File: `src/app/(tabs)/race/add.tsx:56`
   - Issue: `// TODO: Save to Supabase` - form validates but doesn't save
   - Impact: Users can't actually create races
   - Fix: Implement Supabase insert with RLS policies

2. **Document Agent Knowledge Base Mocked** ⚠️
   - File: `src/services/agents/DocumentProcessingAgent.ts:329-344`
   - Issue: `save_to_knowledge_base` returns mock IDs, doesn't persist
   - Impact: AI-extracted course data not saved for reuse
   - Fix: Implement Supabase insert to `ai_analyses` or `documents` table

3. **PDF Parsing Not Implemented** ⚠️
   - File: `src/app/(tabs)/race/strategy.tsx:90-101`
   - Issue: Falls back to mock text for PDFs
   - Impact: Can't process real sailing instructions PDFs
   - Fix: Integrate `react-native-pdf` or PDF.js for text extraction

4. **Upload Documents Screen Disconnected** ℹ️
   - File: `src/app/upload-documents.tsx`
   - Issue: Basic UI with mock data, not connected to DocumentProcessingAgent
   - Impact: Standalone upload screen doesn't leverage AI
   - Fix: Wire to agent or consolidate with race/strategy upload flow

### Missing Integrations

1. **Member Management System** ❌
   - No screens found for club member CRUD
   - Club dashboard exists but lacks member tools
   - Needed for club persona completeness

2. **Live Scoring Interface** ❓
   - Results entry screens exist
   - Real-time scoring UI not verified
   - May be in race control panel (needs deeper check)

3. **Subscription Management UI** ℹ️
   - Pricing section exists on landing page
   - No user-facing subscription dashboard found
   - Stripe subscriptions configured but no UI for plan management

4. **3D Course → AI Strategy Connection** ⚠️
   - Course visualization is standalone
   - Doesn't feed data back to strategy generator
   - Manual marks in course.tsx (lines 164-197) vs extracted marks from agent

### Recommendations

#### High Priority (Blocking Features)

3. **PDF Parsing Integration** (4-6 hours)
   - Add `@react-pdf/renderer` or `react-native-pdf`
   - Extract text from uploaded PDFs
   - Fall back to OCR for images (Tesseract.js)

#### Medium Priority (UX Improvements)
4. **Connect 3D Viz to AI** (2-3 hours)
   - Pass extracted course marks to course.tsx
   - Replace hardcoded marks (lines 164-197) with dynamic data
   - Link "Generate Strategy" button to agent

5. **Consolidate Upload Flows** (1-2 hours)
   - Merge upload-documents.tsx with race strategy upload
   - Single document management system
   - Consistent AI processing pipeline

   - Handicap system integration

9. **Weather Data Integration** (4-6 hours)
   - Replace mocked weather in course.tsx
   - Connect to regional weather APIs

### Code Quality Notes

**Excellent**:
- Coach booking flow is production-ready (574 lines, fully typed)
- 3D course visualization is impressive (981 lines, OnX Maps quality)
- Payment infrastructure is robust (6 edge functions, error handling)
- Agent architecture is clean and extensible

**Needs Improvement**:
- Race creation has incomplete database integration
- Document upload flows are fragmented across 3+ screens
- Mock data used in many places (weather, course marks, strategies)

### Next Steps

**If deploying soon**:
1. Fix race creation Supabase save (CRITICAL)
2. Implement PDF parsing (HIGH)
3. Connect AI extractions to course viz (HIGH)

**If building out**:
4. Add member management (MEDIUM)
5. Verify/complete scoring system (MEDIUM)
6. Build subscription dashboard (LOW)
