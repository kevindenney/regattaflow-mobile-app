## 📝 Mock vs Real Data

### Currently Using Mock Data:
1. **FleetRacersCard** - Participants (until users register)
2. **ContingencyPlansCard** - Scenarios (until tactical engine generates)
3. **RaceDocumentsCard** - Documents (until users upload)

### Already Using Real Data:
1. **TacticalPlanCard** - Loads/generates from DB ✅
2. **CrewEquipmentCard** - Loads from `crew_members` ✅
3. **Race metadata** - All race info from `regattas` ✅

### To Switch to Real Data:

**For Fleet Participants:**
Users need to register for races. Add a "Register for Race" button:
```tsx
<TouchableOpacity onPress={async () => {
  await raceParticipantService.registerForRace({
    userId: user.id,
    regattaId: race.id,
    fleetId: 'fleet-id',
    boatName: 'My Boat',
    sailNumber: 'HKG 123',
    visibility: 'public'
  });
}}>
  <Text>Register for Race</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

**For Documents:**
Upload handler already connected, just needs UI flow.

---

## 🔮 Enhancement Opportunities

### Immediate:
1. **Add Registration Button**: Let users register for races
2. **Document Upload Flow**: Connect to document picker
3. **Crew Management Navigation**: Link "Manage" button
4. **Fleet Discovery**: Auto-populate fleets for venues

### Short Term:
1. **Real-time Updates**: Subscribe to race participant changes
2. **Fleet Notifications**: Alert when fleet members join
3. **Document Sync**: Auto-download fleet-shared documents
4. **Crew Availability**: Check availability for race dates

### Long Term:
1. **Fleet Chat**: In-app messaging (beyond WhatsApp)
2. **Live Leaderboards**: Show fleet rankings during race
3. **Document Annotations**: Mark up documents collaboratively
4. **Equipment Checklists**: Pre-race equipment verification

---

## 🎨 Design Consistency

All new components follow your existing design:
- ✅ Apple Weather-inspired cards
- ✅ Scrollable vertical layout
- ✅ Design system colors & spacing
- ✅ Material Community Icons
- ✅ Consistent padding/margins
- ✅ Elevation & shadows
