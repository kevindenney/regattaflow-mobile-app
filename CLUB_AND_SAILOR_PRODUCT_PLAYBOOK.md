# RegattaFlow Club & Sailor Product Playbook

## Executive Summary
- Deliver a single source of truth for regatta preparation, execution, and communication by building robust club admin tools first, then exposing curated data to sailors.
- Launch a revenue-ready entry and payment pipeline so clubs can accept registrations, manage waivers, reconcile payouts, and keep rosters synchronized.
- Provide sailors with a branded, mobile-first hub for results, standings, documents, and race-day updates fed by real-time inputs from race officers.
- Extend club storytelling beyond RegattaFlow via configurable white-label microsites and embeddable widgets that publish live data to any external property.

## Problem Statement
Clubs juggle fragmented spreadsheets, payment forms, and email chains to run regattas. Sailors receive inconsistent updates and lack a cohesive place to plan, register, and review performance. RegattaFlow must centralize operations, monetization, and communications while preserving clubs' branding and workflows.

## Personas & Primary Jobs
- **Club Administrator** – Plan the season, publish notices, manage memberships, settle finances.
- **Race Officer / PRO** – Configure courses, record results, issue updates during racing.
- **Sailor / Team Lead** – Discover events, enter races, pay fees, consume documents, track standings, complete compliance tasks.

## Experience Pillars
1. **Authoritative Data Backbone** – Every published artifact (entry list, results, NOR, SI, course card) originates from RegattaFlow so there is one canonical record.
2. **Frictionless Commerce** – Entries, payments, refunds, and credits live in one workflow with ledger visibility for treasurers and skippers.
3. **Targeted Communications** – Notices, race-day alerts, and documents reach the right audience (public vs members vs entrants) on any channel.
4. **Branded Publishing Anywhere** – Clubs choose between an instantly generated microsite or embedded widgets to surface RegattaFlow content on existing domains.

## User Journeys

### Club Administrator Setup
1. Authenticate into the club console and import/verify membership roster.
2. Create a regatta (dates, fleets, scoring, entry caps) and configure pricing tiers, coupon codes, waivers, and payment settlement instructions.
3. Upload or author NOR/SI templates, flag required documents, and choose public vs member-only visibility.
4. Publish the regatta which simultaneously opens registration, populates the calendar, and generates microsite sections/widgets for external use.

### Race Officer Race Day Workflow
1. Review the race schedule, courses, and mark sets defined by the club admin.
2. Push day-of-race updates (course assignments, postponements, safety notices) that broadcast to sailors and the microsite in real time.
3. Record finishes via the mobile or tablet interface; scoring automation updates provisional and official standings.
4. Close racing, approve final results, and trigger result notifications plus archive to the club’s document library.

### Sailor Engagement Lifecycle
1. Receive invite or self-register through the club-branded microsite or RegattaFlow app.
2. View upcoming regattas, enter events, complete waivers, and pay fees through a streamlined checkout.
3. Monitor entry status, outstanding balance, assigned divisions, and document tasks on the personalized dashboard.
4. On race day, access mobile race packets, course overlays, and live notices; afterwards, see results, analytics, and download certificates.
