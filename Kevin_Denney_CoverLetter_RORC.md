**Re:** Racing Coordinator Position

---

Dear Hiring Committee,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Racing Coordinator position at the Royal Ocean Racing Club. Having dedicated over two decades to sailing—as a racer, coach, and now as founder of a regatta management platform—I am deeply motivated by the opportunity to contribute to RORC's world-leading offshore racing programme.

**Sailing Credentials & Race Coordination**

My connection to sailing runs deep. I began racing Optimists at age nine and progressed through dinghies to keelboat racing on the Great Lakes, competing in T-10s, J-30s, J-105s, and Etchells. I have offshore racing experience across three continents—South Africa, Asia, and North America—giving me firsthand understanding of the demands and rewards of ocean racing.

I currently serve on the organising committee for the Dragon World Championship 2027 at the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club, where I contributed to the successful bid that secured Hong Kong as host. This role involves race coordination, event logistics, and working with international stakeholders—experience directly relevant to the Racing Coordinator position at RORC.

For 19 years, I served as a Sailing Coach and Clinic Leader with North Sails NorthU, delivering racing clinics, coordinating programme logistics, and working with sailors at every level. I also held a managerial role at Steve Colgate's Offshore Sailing School, where I oversaw operations, instructor coordination, and programme delivery. During this time, I earned my US Coast Guard Master's Licence and US Sailing Instructor certifications—credentials that reflect my commitment to professional standards in the sport.

**Understanding Race Management**

I am currently building RegattaFlow, a comprehensive sailing strategy and regatta management platform serving sailors, coaches, and clubs. This work has given me an intimate understanding of race management from both the competitor and organiser perspectives—from entry systems and results processing to fleet administration and competitor communications. I appreciate the complexity of delivering racing programmes that meet the expectations of discerning sailors while managing the operational realities of venues, volunteers, and regulatory requirements.

**Organisational Leadership**

As Director of the Li Ka Shing Design and Innovation Center at Hong Kong Polytechnic University (2019–2026), I led complex multi-stakeholder initiatives across academic, corporate, and government sectors. This role honed my ability to coordinate diverse teams, manage competing priorities, and deliver high-quality outcomes under pressure—skills directly transferable to race programme coordination.

**Fit with RORC**

I am drawn to RORC's unique position as the world's leading offshore racing organisation and the steward of iconic events like the Rolex Fastnet Race. The Club's values—excellence, tradition, and a genuine love of the sea—resonate with my own. I am fully prepared for the irregular hours and travel that race periods demand; this is part of what makes racing special.

I am ready to relocate to Cowes and commit fully to supporting the Racing Manager and the broader RORC team in delivering an outstanding racing programme.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience might serve the Club. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,

**Kevin Denney**
