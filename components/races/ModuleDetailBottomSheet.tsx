/**
 * ModuleDetailBottomSheet - AI-Powered Module Learning Workspace
 *
 * Each module tile opens into an experiential learning environment where
 * students actively prepare for their shift/session/workout. Not a static
 * info page — a living workspace that:
 *
 * 1. YOUR PLAN — Student inputs their unique approach, ideas, clinical reasoning
 * 2. AI COACH — Contextual prompts that build on past experience + community knowledge
 * 3. FROM YOUR NETWORK — Insights from preceptors, peers, people they follow
 * 4. YOUR HISTORY — What they documented in past shifts for this module
 *
 * The AI Coach isn't generic advice — it references the student's actual
 * past performance, flags gaps, asks Socratic questions, and surfaces
 * what experienced practitioners in their network have shared.
