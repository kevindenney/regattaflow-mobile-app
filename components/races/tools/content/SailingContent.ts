      title: 'Read the Racecourse',
      body: 'The sailors who win aren\'t faster — they\'re smarter about conditions. Wind shifts, current lines, and pressure changes are the invisible chess board. Your last race, you identified the persistent shift early and gained 5 boats on the first beat. Keep developing that instinct.',

      summary: '24 races logged • Best results in 8-14 knots oscillating',

    aiCoach: {
      title: 'Plan to Win, Adapt to Conditions',
      body: 'A strategy isn\'t a rigid plan — it\'s a framework for making fast decisions on the water. Go in with a plan, but hold it loosely. The best sailors have a Plan A and a Plan B before the gun. Your risk management has improved — you\'re protecting top-5 finishes instead of gambling for first.',
      question: 'Where is the pressure? Which side of the course has more wind? That\'s where you want to be.',
    },
    network: [
      { name: 'Sarah L.', role: 'Olympic campaigner', tip: 'I make my strategy decision in the last 3 minutes before the start. Everything before that is data collection. Committing too early means you miss late changes.' },
      { name: 'Marcus K.', role: 'Match race tactician', tip: 'Think in legs, not the whole race. Win the first beat, then reassess. Many sailors plan the entire race and miss what\'s actually happening.' },

    history: {
      summary: 'Strategy notes from 18 races • Trending toward right side preference',

      title: 'Set Up for the Conditions',
      body: 'Rig setup is the foundation everything else sits on. A well-tuned rig in the right mode for the conditions is free speed. You don\'t have to be the best sailor if your boat is set up faster. Your upwind trim has improved — the telltales are flowing consistently now.',

      { name: 'Jake M.', role: 'Dragon class champion', tip: 'Rig tune is 80% of your speed upwind. Get the basics right: forestay tension controls headstay sag which controls jib shape. Everything follows from there.' },
    ],
    history: {
      summary: 'Tuning notes from 12 races • Light air setup improving',

    aiCoach: {
      title: 'Know the Chessboard',
      body: 'Understanding the course geometry helps you plan your angles and laylines before you\'re in the heat of racing. Where are the marks relative to the wind? Are gates offset? Is there a reach leg where you can gain or lose? Visual the course before you sail it.',
      question: 'Can you draw the course from memory? If not, study the sailing instructions again. Knowing the course cold removes one variable from your decision-making.',
    },
    network: [
      { name: 'Sarah L.', role: 'Olympic campaigner', tip: 'I always sail past the weather mark before the race to check the layline angles and look for current around the mark. 5 minutes of recon saves 30 seconds of racing.' },

    notesPrompt: 'Who\'s fast in these conditions? Who are you racing against for position? What are the hot boats doing for setup?',
    aiCoach: {
      title: 'Race the Fleet, Not the Course',
      body: 'Knowing who\'s fast and what they\'re doing gives you reference points on the water. If the top boats are all going left, there\'s probably a reason. You don\'t have to copy them — but you should understand why before going the other way.',
      question: 'Who are the 3 boats you\'re most likely to be racing against today? What do they do well?',
    },
    network: [

      title: 'Win the Start, Control the Race',
      body: 'A great start doesn\'t guarantee a win, but a bad start almost guarantees a loss. The start is the one moment where preparation beats talent. Know the line bias, have your time-distance dialed, and have a backup plan if your spot is taken.',
      question: 'Which end is favored? Have you sailed both ends to check? Sometimes the "wrong" end has better lanes.',
    },
    network: [
      { name: 'Jake M.', role: 'Dragon class champion', tip: 'I do 2 practice starts every day before racing. Not full-speed port-starboard — just time-distance approaches to the line. It calibrates my timing.' },

  tide_currents: {
    notesPrompt: 'What\'s the tidal state? Current strength and direction across the course? How does it change during the race?',
    aiCoach: {
      title: 'The Hidden Variable',
      body: 'Current is the great equalizer — it affects everyone equally, but those who account for it gain a massive edge. Even a quarter knot can mean 2 boat lengths per minute. That\'s the difference between rounding the mark in clear air or in a pack.',
      question: 'Will the current change during the race? If the tide turns, does that change which side of the course pays?',
    },
    network: [
      { name: 'Tom R.', role: 'Boat builder / tuner', tip: 'Drop a floating object near a mark and watch which way it moves. The tide tables tell you what should happen — your eyes tell you what IS happening.' },

    history: {
      summary: '12 races with significant current • Learning tidal patterns',

    notesPrompt: 'Notes on key competitors: who\'s fast today, who\'s on form, anyone to watch or avoid?',
    aiCoach: {
      title: 'Know Your Rivals',
      body: 'The best competitors study their competition. Not to copy, but to understand. What sails are they using? What side of the course do they favor? Where do they like to start? This intelligence helps you make better decisions under pressure.',
      question: 'Who finished ahead of you in the last race? What did they do differently that you could learn from?',
    },
    network: [
      { name: 'Marcus K.', role: 'Match race tactician', tip: 'Keep a notebook on your top 5 rivals. Over a season, patterns emerge: boat 42 always goes left, boat 17 wins at mark roundings. Knowledge is tactical advantage.' },

  team_assignments: {
    notesPrompt: 'Crew roles and assignments: who\'s doing what? Any special maneuver plans? Communication calls?',
    aiCoach: {
      title: 'The Crew Makes the Boat',
      body: 'Boat speed is a team sport. Clear role assignments and practiced communication make maneuvers smooth and fast. The best teams don\'t just know what to do — they know what to say and when. Your crew\'s tacking has gotten crisper since you standardized the calls.',
      question: 'Does every crew member know their role at every mark rounding? Walk through it verbally before the race.',
    },
    network: [
      { name: 'Jake M.', role: 'Dragon class champion', tip: 'We brief every mark rounding before the start. "Rounding to port, kite up, skipper calls the peel." No surprises, no confusion.' },

    aiCoach: {
      title: 'Align Your Team',
      body: 'Sharing your race plan with the crew isn\'t a lecture — it\'s a conversation. The best crews co-create strategy because the trimmer sees different things than the helm. Brief together, debrief together, improve together.',
      question: 'Before you share: has every crew member had a chance to contribute their observations?',
    },
    network: [
      { name: 'Sarah L.', role: 'Olympic campaigner', tip: 'I share my pre-race notes with my crew via the app the night before. It means we show up already aligned and use dock time for fine-tuning, not briefing from scratch.' },

    history: {
      summary: '8 team shares this season • Crew engagement: high',

    aiCoach: {
      title: 'Know the Rules of the Game',
      body: 'Knowing the racing rules and sailing instructions isn\'t about being a sea lawyer — it\'s about racing with confidence. When you know your rights, you can push harder at marks and starts without fear of a protest. When you don\'t, you give up water unnecessarily.',
      question: 'Have you read the sailing instructions? Are there any special rules or course changes for today?',
    },
    network: [

    aiCoach: {
      title: 'Study Your Opponent',
      body: 'Match racing is chess on water. Knowing your opponent\'s tendencies — their preferred start, their comfort zone, their weak maneuvers — gives you the ability to dictate the race. Force them into uncomfortable situations.',
      question: 'What does your opponent do when they\'re behind? That\'s where you want to keep them.',
    },
    network: [

    aiCoach: {
      title: 'Plan the Long Game',
      body: 'Distance racing rewards patience and planning. Every waypoint is a decision point — do you follow the rhumb line or play the weather routing? The best distance sailors think 3 waypoints ahead. Your last offshore race showed great tactical patience.',
      question: 'What\'s the key decision point on this race? Where will the race be won or lost?',
    },
    network: [
      { name: 'Tom R.', role: 'Offshore navigator', tip: 'In distance racing, the weather file changes every 6 hours. Re-route every time new data comes in. The boats that re-route win.' },
