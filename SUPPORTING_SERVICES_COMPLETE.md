# ✅ Supporting Services Complete!

**Date**: October 2, 2025
**Status**: Phase 3 Complete - All 5 Supporting Services Implemented

## Summary

RegattaFlow's supporting services layer is complete! These services are called by AI agents and provide the core functionality for sailor onboarding, fleet discovery, race tracking, and calendar imports.

## Implemented Services

### 1. ✅ LocationDetectionService
**File**: `src/services/LocationDetectionService.ts`
**Purpose**: GPS venue detection and location management

**Key Methods**:
- `detectCurrentLocation()` - GPS → venue matching with confidence scoring
  - High confidence: < 10km from venue
  - Medium confidence: 10-25km from venue
  - Low confidence: > 25km from venue
- `searchLocations(query)` - Search venues by name/city/country
- `addSailorLocation(sailorId, venueId)` - Add location to sailor profile
- `getSailorLocations(sailorId)` - Get all sailor locations
- `getPrimaryLocation(sailorId)` - Get primary home location
- `setPrimaryLocation(sailorId, locationId)` - Set primary location (unsets others)
- `removeSailorLocation(sailorId, locationId)` - Remove location
- `calculateDistance(coord1, coord2)` - Haversine formula for GPS distance

**Technologies**:
- Expo Location API for GPS
- PostGIS `venues_within_radius` RPC for spatial queries
- Haversine distance calculation

**Called by**: OnboardingAgent's `detect_venue_from_gps` and `search_sailing_venues` tools

### 4. ✅ RaceTimerService
**File**: `src/services/RaceTimerService.ts`
**Purpose**: GPS-tracked countdown timer for race performance

**Key Methods**:
- `startSession(sailorId, regattaId, conditions)` - Start GPS tracking session

- `isAnalyzed(sessionId)` - Check if AI has analyzed session
- `getUnanalyzedSessions(sailorId)` - Get sessions pending AI analysis
- `cancelActiveSession()` - Cleanup incomplete session

**GPS Tracking**:
- Records point every 5 seconds during race
- Captures: latitude, longitude, speed, heading, altitude
- Stores as JSONB track_points array
- Automatic duration calculation

**Race Conditions**:
- Wind direction/speed
- Wave height
- Final position in fleet
- Fleet size

**Used by**: RaceAnalysisAgent for performance analysis

## Data Flow Examples

### Complete Onboarding Flow
```typescript
// 1. GPS detects venue
const location = await LocationDetectionService.detectCurrentLocation();
// → Hong Kong (high confidence)

// 2. Discover fleets based on venue + boat class
const fleets = await FleetDiscoveryService.discoverFleets(
  location.venue.id,  // Hong Kong
  'dragon-class-id'   // Dragon
);
// → Hong Kong Dragon Fleet (35 members, top result)

// 3. Discover clubs based on venue
const clubs = await ClubDiscoveryService.discoverClubsByVenue(location.venue.id);
// → RHKYC, Hebe Haven YC

// 4. Discover class associations based on boat class
const associations = await ClubDiscoveryService.discoverAssociationsByClass('dragon-class-id');
// → International Dragon Association

// 5. Join fleet
await FleetDiscoveryService.joinFleet(sailorId, fleetId, true);

// 6. Add club memberships with auto-import
await ClubDiscoveryService.addYachtClubMembership(sailorId, clubId, true);
await ClubDiscoveryService.addClassAssociationMembership(sailorId, assocId, true);

// 7. Auto-import races
const importResult = await RaceScrapingService.autoImportForSailor(sailorId);
// → Imported 12 races from RHKYC + International Dragon Association
```

### Race Day Flow
```typescript
// 1. Start GPS tracking
const session = await RaceTimerService.startSession(
  sailorId,
  regattaId,
  { wind_direction: 225, wind_speed: 15, wave_height: 0.5 }
);

// 2. GPS tracks every 5 seconds during race
// ... race in progress ...

// 3. Finish race
await RaceTimerService.endSession(session.id, 3, 15); // 3rd of 15 boats

// 4. AI analyzes performance (RaceAnalysisAgent uses RaceTimerService.getSession)
const analysis = await RaceAnalysisAgent.analyzeRace({
  timerSessionId: session.id
});
```
