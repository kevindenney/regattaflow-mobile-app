## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

the U.S. Virgin Islands aboard my fifty-four-foot ocean
racer, Sleuth, the skipper of another yacht came up to me
and said, in mock seriousness, that he was protesting me.
He said since we touched bottom off the tip of a two-mile-
long island that was a mark of the course, and failed to
reround the mark (the island) after touching it, we would
be disqualified. Thinking fast, I responded that there is a
rule and an appeal on the subject that states the underwa-
ter part of a mark is not considered part of the mark. A
yacht can touch the ground tackle, for instance, and not be
required to reround.
In another example, the legendary Arthur Knapp was
being beaten to the finish line by a particularly nervous
skipper in first place who kept looking back to see if
Arthur was gaining. Every time he looked back Arthur
slapped the side of the boat or spun a winch. This rattled
the skipper ahead enough that Arthur squeaked across the
finish line in first place.
Another tactic along this line described by Arthur
Knapp was that of a very good downwind skipper who
would engage nearby skippers in conversation to distract
them from steering well. He had no trouble talking and
steering so he invariably gained.
During an SORC race, Heritage was to leeward of Sleuth
without luffing rights on a reach. They came up, were
blanketed, fell off, and tried unsuccessfully to break
through farther to leeward. They came up again, and tried
to distract me with a great deal of shouting and close quar-
ters maneuvering off our lee rail. They yelled that I was
illegally coming down on them even though I was steering
a steady compass course. I called back that if they luffed
me once more they were ending up in a protest meeting,
and then ignored them to concentrate on steering. They
shortly dropped back, and went to windward of us past our
stern.
After finishing races some skippers sail very hard to
demoralize others. If a skipper and crew appear to be so

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
