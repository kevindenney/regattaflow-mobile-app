while boat A continues on in an extended header, they
may very well change places, as shown by the dotted lines
in Figure 41. Then boat B is in position to take advantage

of the next lift, and boat A has ended up on the outside of
the lift, a very poor position indeed.
When the crew of boat B notices that suddenly in posi-
tion 2 they are looking very good on boat A, as if their speed
has greatly increased, they figure that something’s fishy.
Since such a jump in speed isn’t likely, they determine
they’ve been headed and tack. So without looking at the
compass they have been able to play the wind shift well.
Finn dinghy sailors and those who sail other single-
handed sailboats understand windshifts from boat rela-
tionships very well. Once I was sailing with Peter Barrett,
an Olympic medalist in the Finn class, and we were in the
position of boat B in Figure 42 on page 60. We were coming
up to a windward finish ahead. I felt we could just about
cross boat A if we tacked at position 1. I suggested to Peter
that we consolidate our position by getting to windward of
boat A and covering her. We both were laying the finish,
but boat A, with a lightweight crew, was moving much
faster in the light air we had. Peter kept on sailing on
-starboard for a few moments, and then said, “Now, let’s

tack.” At that time, in position 2, I looked back at boat A,
and saw we could cross easily. Since we were still laying
the finish line (a layline is an imaginary line indicating
the last tack to the windward mark) I wondered why Peter
had chosen to cover at a time when we looked so good. It
hardly seemed necessary now that we were handily beat-
ing boat A. Even if she caught up, she would have trouble

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
