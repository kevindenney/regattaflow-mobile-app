bers 265° and 270° called out, they know they are being
lifted. While higher numbers are good on starboard tack,
they are generally bad on port since they indicate a
header.
There are times when good skippers will ignore the indi-
cation of a header. For instance, when the wind velocity
decreases, the apparent wind goes forward. The skipper
will have to sail a lower course and has apparently been
headed. The true wind direction, however, has remained
the same. The best skippers, like Buddy Melges, have the
wind velocity totally cranked into their mental computers,
and don’t necessarily tack in headers if they are created by
wind-velocity changes.
A change in velocity can completely disorient the more
inexperienced skipper. The scenario is as follows: the boat
sails into a hole in the wind, and the apparent wind,
created by the boat speed, goes forward. Being “headed,”
the skipper decides to tack. As the boat turns into the wind
the sails fill because the apparent wind comes aft due to
the boat’s rotation. The skipper decides the header was
temporary and aborts the tack. By the time the boat settles
back down on the original tack, the boat speed has di-
minished considerably, the apparent wind is no longer
forward, and the skipper’s decision to abort appears
vindicated. Yet the true wind has never changed direction.
Only the velocity changed.
Another way of spotting headers and lifts, one that
doesn’t depend on the compass, is to observe the heading
of other boats. Boats A and B are abeam of each other in
Figure 41, position 1. Along comes a big header, as in posi-
tion 2, and boat B forges ahead. When a large lift comes,
as in position 3, it benefits the “inside boat,” boat A, the
most. The boats have won or lost great distances, but have
been moving through the water at exactly the same speed.
It’s obvious from the diagram that one wants to be the
leeward boat in a header and the windward boat in a lift.
But how is that possible? If, when headed, boat B tacks

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
