keep her from passing you. If you had tacked right on the
layline, she would be past it due to her relative position,
and could possibly drive over you at the mark were it nec-
essary for you to pinch near the end of the leg. The defen-
Sive tactic on the part of the leeward boat, as mentioned
before, is a sharp luff short of the layline. This will work
only if the windward boat is caught unawares. The wind-
ward boat should keep enough open water between her
and her opponent to negate the effectiveness of a luff.
Another overstanding tactic is used when a leeward boat
is being covered by a boat to windward and ahead, as in
Figure 54. The leeward skipper is banking on the hope

that the windward crew will be totally engrossed in cover-
ing him. As the leeward boat approaches the layline, the
skipper pinches and slows the boat. This results in the
windward boat’s sailing farther past the layline while the
leeward boat sails slowly. It further allows the leeward
boat to pinch up closer to the mark. The leeward boat
keeps on going slowly past the layline until the windward
skipper comes to his senses, realizes he has overstood, and
tacks first. Normally, he will be waiting for the leeward
boat to tack first, and will then cover. Figure 54 shows the
desired result. The leeward boat should at least maintain
an inside overlap at the mark and come out ahead.
Pete Conrad of Sobstad Sailmakers mentions a tactic that
can often be used to advantage. He was sailing in a Finn
Class National Championship and was just about laying
the weather mark on starboard tack in a breeze that was
gradually lifting him. The lead Finn was close to crossing
him, and the last thing he wanted was for the leader to tack
and to feed him bad air all the way to the mark. So Pete
shouted something to the effect of, ‘““Go ahead across, you
have it made,” whereupon his opponent took the bait,

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
