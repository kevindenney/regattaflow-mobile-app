## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

trary or cross-current situation, the best course is the
shortest distance, and, thus, the shortest time in the effect
of the current. You often know roughly the strength and
direction of the current from current tables studied before
the race. Just how much it is affecting you can be seen
after you’ve sailed down the leg for a while. Steer your boat
directly at the jibing mark ahead and glance astern. With
no current the weather mark should be dead astern. If it’s
more to the starboard side of the boat, you’ve been set to
the left of the course and vice versa. When the jibing mark
can be easily distinguished against a shore line, try to steer
your boat so the shore doesn’t move behind the buoy. If the
buoy moves to the right along the shore, you are being set
to the left of course by the current, and must steer more to
starboard to offset it.
