travention of the rule against movable ballast.
Just before the start of an ocean race in England in 1971,
an Italian yacht, late for the start, was powering at full
speed toward the starting line with only a minute to go

before the gun. We raised a protest flag since she should
have turned off her engine, or at least gone into neutral
gear, five minutes before the start. More surprising than
the rule infringement was their reaction to our protest.
They couldn’t believe it, as if they considered the rule a
minor one made to be broken. One wonders if they also use
their engine on the race course when it’s calm and there’s
no other yacht around to spot them.
These have been examples of incidents that are clearly
illegal. The problem is that propulsion such as “pumping”
is becoming considered more immoral than illegal. That
justifies its use in many racer’s eyes because winning can
be considered more important than insignificant morals.
Let’s assume that we are dealing with totally legal tac-
tics in this book. There is still a whole set of tactics used
both on and off the race course that are both fascinating
and effective. I refer to psychological tactics. All sports use
them and sailing is no exception.
Let’s say you are being closely covered by another boat,
and you want to split tacks with him. Yet every tack you
make is matched by the other boat either on your wind or
close to it. Just keep tacking. Never give up after two tacks
because you think he’s going to match every tack you
make. Usually you’ll break away after the third tack. He
decides that a tacking duel with you is not worth the dis-
tance lost to other boats. If yours is the only boat he needs
to beat in a series, he may hold on longer, but usually three
tacks is the magic number.
There are some psychological tactics used off the race
course. Before a big series, when most everyone is nervous

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
