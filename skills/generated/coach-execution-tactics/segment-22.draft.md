you completely clear the line if his attention is momentar-
ily directed elsewhere, and may call you over early when
he sees you in a good position right after the gun. More-
over, if you are reaching or running down on starboard
tack, all the boats to leeward of you have right of way
because, as windward boat, you must keep clear. Unless
you can find a hole, all the boats already on the line can
hold you up on the wrong side of it. For that reason, an
approach on port tack is often better than starboard. In
Figure 12, boat A on starboard tack is unable to find a hole,
and ends up running parallel to the line with boats hold-
ing her to the wrong side. Boat B on port tack sails against
the flow of starboard tack boats, and is able to select a hole
to jibe or tack into.
With current setting you downwind, this type of start
makes even more sense. If you sail around upcurrent of
the line and the wind dies, you will drift across to the
wind

proper side, and still be upwind of your competitors who
have drifted even farther downwind of the line. You are in
the same relationship to the other boats as before, but it’s
as if the line moved upcurrent as the fleet was pushed
downcurrent (see Figure 13).

If you want to start at the starboard end of the line with
current carrying you downwind, a “barging start” can be
relatively safe. By “barging” we mean placing yourself in
a position where a leeward boat can luff you into a starting
mark. In this example (see Figure 14 on page 26), let’s stick
to the starboard end with the committee boat there, since
with windward starts and marks left to port, that’s the way
the line is usually set up. The “anti-barging rule” states:
“When approaching the starting line to start, a leeward
yacht shall be under no obligation to give any windward

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
