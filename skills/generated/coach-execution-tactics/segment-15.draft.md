were on the line when he said so. We sailed around behind
the committee boat, and reaching toward it, we lined up
the starting line flag with the buoy. The true range was the
buoy in line with the inner span (see Figure 3). My skipper
was flabbergasted that he was so far off in his judgment.
The bridge was an ideal range, but you can use anything
along the shore, such as a roof or a tree. You must remem-
ber as you approach the line that your range was taken
from the cockpit. Allow for the fact that your bow will
reach the line before you are on the range.
The timing and distance from the line can be guessed by
how quickly the bearing changes along the shore. The
farther you are from the buoy, the slower the bearing
changes, as shown in Figure 4. If the bearing is changing
fast, be careful not to poke your bow over the line. If it’s
changing slowly, you can get quite close to the cockpit
range you took and still be safe.
