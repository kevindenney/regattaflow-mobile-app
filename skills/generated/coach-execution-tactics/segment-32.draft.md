in the fleet, is on the outside of a lift, and every boat to
windward has her tucked away.
There are some excellent sailors, like Peter Barrett,
Olympic gold medalist, who use port tack approaches on
almost every start. Whereas the starboard tack boat has to
hold her course, except to assume a proper course to start,
the port tack boat has greater flexibility. She just has to
avoid the starboard tack boats, and can choose an opening
to tack onto starboard for her own approach. A pure port
tack start is rare, but a port tack approach is fairly com-
mon and reasonable. The former works best when the port
end of the line is so favored that boats can barely cross it
on starboard tack. Line A in Figure 28 on page 40 is such
a situation. The port tack boat will have little trouble

crossing the starboard tackers, because they are almost in
a straight line bow to stern. The port tack boat in line B
where the wind is almost square will have major problems
crossing, and will probably have to tack.
Weigh a port tack start very carefully. Instant disqualifi-
cation isn’t a very good way to start a race. Moreover, the
port tack may be taking you away from a more desirable
area. In one recent race, I considered a port tack start
because the port end was well upwind. However, there
was a nearby shore with shallower water, less current, and
usually a port tack lift. Since we had to get to that shore
on starboard anyway, I decided to save a tack and to start
on starboard (see Figure 29). Also, the committee boat was
at that end, which makes a port tack start there more
dangerous. If you are forced to tack by a starboard tack
yacht, you can’t avoid hitting the committee boat. Aries,
with Lowell North steering, made a perfect port tack start,
and barely squeaked across Sleuth on starboard. We car-
ried into the shore, got slightly headed, and tacked. When

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
