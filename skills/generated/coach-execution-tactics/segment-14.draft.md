take to cover a short distance than a long one, which is an
additional reason for a three-minute pattern. In smaller
boats, which accelerate more rapidly, the pattern may be
even shorter. (In dinghies and catamarans, there is hardly
a discernible time pattern. You just choose your spot on the
starting line, sit there with sails luffiing until seconds be-
fore the gun sounds, trim in and go.)
The pattern, correctly undertaken, will get you near the
line at the gun. The next problem is to know how close to
the line you are. There is often a large sag in a string of
boats starting, for skippers often judge the location of the
starting line by their relation to other boats. Consider the
skipper of boat A in Figure 2 (on page 14). He looks toward
the race committee boat, and thinks that two competitors
are right on the line to windward of him. A glance toward
the buoy makes him feel that the nearest boat to leeward
may be over the line early and is reaching off. The other
boats appear to be right on the line. The truth is that all
the boats are well behind the starting line. The skipper of
boat A is the victim of a mistaken sense of perspective,
since he cannot look at both ends of the line at the same
time.
The solution is to find a way to look in only one direction
to know how close you are to the line. This is done by
taking a range. The most common way is to line up the
starting line with a point on shore. Whenever I crew, I urge

the skipper to get a range before the start. While sailing a
Soling series in Annapolis with an internationally known
skipper, I was having trouble getting the point across. He
said, “Okay, Steve, we’re on the line now, and the buoy is
lined up with that outer span on the Chesapeake Bay
Bridge.” My response was that even with the skipper’s
long and varied experience, he was only guessing that we

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
