the intersection of both laylines. You are sailing tactically
among other boats that you may haveto cover or to break
away from. This determines your approach to the line,
which may be quite different from the course you would
have taken in the absence of other boats. Try to judge
whether you are sailing more parallel to the line or more
across it. It sounds like a simple-minded tactic—sail across
the line, not parallel to it—but it’s amazing how many
skippers take the course of boat A in Figure 69 until they
reach the middle of the line and then tack. They should
tack immediately when they can lay the buoy on starboard
tack.
Harry Sindle, many-time national champion in a num-
ber of classes, considers the finish at the completion of the
second weather leg of an Olympic course. Often the com-
mittee boat has moved from the leeward mark where the
race was started, and has set a finish line at the weather
mark. As he tacks to go around the weather mark for the
run, he is crossing what will be the finish line two legs
hence. When head to wind during that tack, he observes
whether either end is abaft abeam. That end will be the
downwind end at the finish, barring any major wind shifts.
If you know the ability of the race committee, you may

be able to tell which end is favored simply by the wind
direction. If the wind is essentially straight down the
course line from the windward mark to the leeward mark,
the finish line will be set perpendicular to the course, and
neither end will be favored. If the wind has veered, and
the finish line is still perpendicular to the course line, then
the port end will be downwind as in Figure 69.
Race committees are now expected to adjust slightly for
the wind direction by splitting the difference between the

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
