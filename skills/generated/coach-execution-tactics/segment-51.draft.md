what the next shift will be. If a header is expected, the
windward boat might tack a little earlier. By so doing,
more is gained by being more in front, rather than dead
upwind, of the leeward boat. However, you are vulnerable
to being hurt worse if a lift occurs instead of a header.
Covering an opponent has to be done with full knowl-
edge of his reactions. When you tack close dead to wind-
ward of another boat, he has no other choice but to tack
away to avoid the bad air from your sails. This means you
have to tack again to cover and possibly even again after
that, assuming your opponent keeps on tacking to get clear
air. There are many instances when such a tacking duel
does neither of you any good. It’s fine if you are match
racing, but in most other races you can lose places to other
boats by spending too much time covering your prime
competition. That’s when a “herding” type of cover is ap-
propriate. You want to go in the same direction as the bulk
of the other boats, for instance, so you cover your opponent
tightly, hurting his air when he is sailing away from the
others.
Boat A in Figure 47 has placed boat B in her wind
shadow. With the others on port tack, splitting tacks with
the fleet can be dangerous. When boat B tacks to get clear
air, boat A carries on for a short distance before tacking so
that B has clear air and no incentive to tack again.
Nonetheless, boat A is still between boat B and the finish.
In effect you are herding him in the direction you want to
go.
Another instance where covering an opponent too
closely is a disadvantage is when you are both sailing in
a lift. A tight cover will force him to tack, and by covering
you will also end up in the header.
To place a tight cover on another boat properly takes
timing and precision. The tack after crossing the opponent
must be made just at the right location and moment so that

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
