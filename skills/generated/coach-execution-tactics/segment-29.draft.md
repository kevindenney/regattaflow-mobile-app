compass reads 035°, the port end is 10° favored. If it reads
060°, the starboard end is 15° favored.
When you shoot into the wind to check its direction,
make sure the boat comes to a complete stop. In light air
the boat’s momentum will carry a long way, and the wind
will appear to be dead ahead while the boat is moving
forward. Only when this forward movement has ceased
can you accurately determine the true wind direction. The
sails, particularly the jib (if it doesn’t overlap the mast)
will luff right over the centerline of the boat when the
wind is dead ahead.
The advantage of the compass system is that you can
check the wind direction a distance from the line in undis-
turbed air, away from other classes that are starting, and
still know which end of the line to play when it’s your turn
to start.
This also has advantages over another system com-
monly used: checking the wind when right on the line and
noting toward which end your bow points. Since the bow
of the luffing sailboat A in Figure 25 is pointing more
toward the buoy than the committee boat, the buoy end is
upwind and favored. Boat B does the same thing from an
extension of the line and sights abeam. If the committee
boat is forward of abeam, the starboard end is favored; aft

The Start oy
of abeam the port end is upwind. The advantage B has
over A’s system is that B knows when he is right on the
line, and has to sight only in one direction. Boat A has to
guess when she’s on the line, and has to sight in both
directions. If the wind’s angle from square is very slight,
B is more apt to pick it up accurately.
If you shoot the wind and find one end of the line very
much favored, consider the possibility that the race com-
mittee might be doing it on purpose. For example, there
may be a known geographical wind shift near some land

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
