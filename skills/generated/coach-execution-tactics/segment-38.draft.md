trim in your sails, get out in front of him, and duck off to
leeward. However, if you feel you have the start timed well
and you expect the leeward boat to charge on through and
run down the line without bothering you, just let him go.
If you expect to be early and you have room to luff head to
wind, keep in mind that no boat can luff you any farther
if you are head to wind already. Any boat to windward has
to keep clear because you are the leeward boat. Mast posi-
tion is not a factor unless you are altering your course
toward the wind. If you have already arrived at your head
to wind position, you are no longer in the process of carry-
ing out a luff, and windward boats (i.e., boats on your star-
board side, since you are still on the starboard tack) have
to keep clear.
