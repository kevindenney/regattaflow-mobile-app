hind a boat to leeward. The aft line gives the same infor-
mation on a boat to windward. Of course, these lines only
work if there are no wind shifts, if you are steering an
accurate closehauled course, and if you have calculated
your tacking angles correctly. Since these are very big ifs,
such lines are used as rough aids rather than absolutes.
There are times when you may want to overstand the
layline. If a boat is ahead and to leeward of you on port
tack as you approach the starboard tack layline, you must
make sure she is unable to tack without fouling you (see
Figure 53). To that end, you bear off for speed, and get close
enough to windward of her that she can’t tack. With her
pinned in that position, you drive her past the layline to
the point when you can fetch the mark easily. Then, when
you tack, you will be able to sail full and fast enough to
