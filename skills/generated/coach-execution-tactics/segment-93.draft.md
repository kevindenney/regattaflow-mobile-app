## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

There are some interesting tactics that crews have used
when racing at night. During the 1980 Southern Ocean
Racing Conference Lipton Cup, Harold Cudmore was
skippering Mistress Quickly. He was close on corrected
time to Kialoa, which was ahead of him closehauled on
starboard tack, and to Ondine, which was slightly behind
and to leeward of Kialoa. Ondine tacked, and, as she
passed between Kialoa and Mistress Quickly, Harold
doused the light that illuminates the jib. Anyone watching
from Kialoa and not seeing any light from Mistress
Quickly as Ondine passed (they were too far apart to see
running lights) would assume that Mistress Quickly had
also tacked, and was blocked from view by Ondine. So
Kialoa tacked to cover, and Mistress Quickly secretly
sailed on toward the Florida shore still on starboard tack.
By being able to break cover, she was able to beat Ondine
boat for boat and Kialoa on corrected time.
Another, not too legal, use of lights employed to outfox
an opponent originated on the Great Lakes in the 1950s. A
boat was equipped with a rheostat that regulated the bril-
liance of her stern light. When the crew had their arch
rival tucked behind them, they would gradually diminish
the intensity of the light so their competitor would think

he was being left behind. The crew of the lead boat would
see flashlights flashing, and hear winches turning, in-
dicating that all sorts of sail adjustments were being made
on the following boat. Since the latter was actually mess-
ing up their sail trim instead of improving it, the lead boat
would in reality start moving out. The intensity of the
stern light was then adjusted upward. Their competition
now believed the adjustments made were helping them
gain back lost distance when the opposite was true.
The best tactic I’ve ever heard of I’ve saved for last. Dick
Tillman was sailing in the Brigade Sailing Championship
at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. He could only
win the series by putting a boat between him and the boat

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
