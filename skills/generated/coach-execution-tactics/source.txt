Foreword
When asked to write this book about racing tactics I was
concerned about creating another dry, repetitious volume
describing the standard tactics we constantly use on the
race course. I wanted to avoid an encyclopedic treatise
covering every possible type of tactics for every imagin-
able sailing situation. That has been attempted before and
makes very heavy reading. Moreover, its value is question-
able. Every tactical situation is slightly different; there-
fore it’s far better for the sailor to have a good foundation
of basic tactics and then improvise according to the cir-
cumstances that prevail at a particular time.
I avoided reading any other books on tactics so that I
wouldn’t be tempted to add a large number of tactics I
myself hadn’t experienced. Yet, because my style of writ-
ing is fairly tight (I have difficulty using a hundred words
to describe that which can be described in ten), I decided

-- 9 of 136 --

Ds Foreword
to augment the book with the refreshing personal experi-
ences of some of the great sailors I’ve encountered over the
years. I didn’t hesitate to ask, because I’ve found the best
sailors are universally generous in their sharing of secrets.
They have the utmost confidence in their own abilities and
are certain that no matter what they give away, they will
prevail. As Dick Stearns told me once when I was exclaim-
ing about the valuable information he was offering one of
our racing programs, “I can tell these people everything I
know and will still beat them on the race course.” As you
will see in the coming pages, my request for personal tales
was willingly answered, a trait that seems symptomatic of
the spirit of the camaraderie and sharing generally found
in the sport of sailing. Those with the knowledge willingly
help those who are learning. Besides these more exclusive
tactics I realized the importance of including all the every-
day ones in order to give the book a solid foundation. They
are written in a personal way because I felt the reader
could better relate to the tactic if I-described it as I had
used it or had seen it used in actual racing situations.
Otherwise the tactic just seems like a bunch of words and
diagrams on paper that have no credence based on reality
or personality.
By using this style of incorporating tactics as much as
possible, I have had a great deal of fun writing this book
and I hope you will have fun reading it. If the enjoyment
of reading it results in better retention, which, in turn,
results in better performance on the race course, then we
all will be justifiably satisfied.

1. What Are Tactics?
Sailboat racing is challenging. To race well takes a com-
bination of intelligence, canniness, strength, stamina,
concentration, and persistence. These translate into the
two necessary ingredients to win: boat speed and tactics. If
we accept the broad dictionary definition of tactics, “the
means to an end” (which is to win), we can even include
boat speed in this definition. This makes the subject of
tactics the most important single factor in successful sail-
boat racing.
Let’s take a narrower view of tactics that eliminates
some of the elements of boat speed. For instance, sail trim,
sail shape, spinnaker work, rig tuning, crew positions,
reefing procedures, helmsmanship, and many other in-
gredients all add up to boat speed. If races were held
against the clock instead of against other boats, these fac-
tors would contribute to a winning effort. Since writing

-- 11 of 136 --

4 The Yachtsman’s Guide to Racing Tactics
about all these facets of racing would make this book un-
necessarily cumbersome, we’ll consider tactics as “the
means to win in proximity with other sailboats,” as op-
posed to winning against the clock.
By this definition certain types of boats are sailed less
“tactically” than others. For instance, in catamarans and
other extremely light, fast boats, speed differences are
measured in many knots rather than fractions of a knot.
If a slight gust of wind can accelerate a boat to 15 knots
while a competitor is doing 10 knots, more will be gained
by sailing toward an area having more wind than by cov-
ering the competitor. Catamarans are notoriously difficult
and slow to tack. If you decide to tack to cover a competitor
to weather, and your boat slows almost to a halt as you do
it, it’s virtually impossible to time the tack correctly. By
the time you complete the tack, the opponent, sailing at 10
knots, is long gone. These boats depend largely on great
differences in boatspeed to win races.
If boats are so evenly matched in speed that races must
be won by other considerations, they become “tactical”
designs. Most one-design classes of keel boats fall into this
category. In non-planing keel boats where speed differ-
ences between competitors are marginal, more depen-
dence upon tactical interplay is necessary. This is not to
say there are no tactics involved in racing catamarans or
centerboard boats. They are just at different levels on the
tactical scale from the purely tactical type of boat.
In many ways sailboat racing tactics are constantly
changing and evolving just as our society changes and
evolves. In fact, many recent changes in racing rules re-
flect the change in society’s attitudes. There was a time
when sailboat racing was a casual Saturday afternoon
affair between gentlemen. If a sailboat hit a racing mark,
the skipper retired from the race, period. As the attitude
toward racing became more competitive and winning
more important, some skippers decided to take the chance
of disqualification rather than retire after hitting a mark.
The injustice of this came to a head during the 1968 Olym-
pics in Mexico when Carl van Duyne, the U.S. Finn class

-- 12 of 136 --

What ae Tactics? 5
representative, hit a mark during one of the races. No one
saw the accident, but Carl did the honorable thing... he
retired. A few races later, a competitor from another coun-
try brushed a mark with his sail. Other Finn sailors and
even the international judge stationed at the mark saw it.
He didn’t retire, was protested, and was not disqualified
because he vehemently denied hitting the mark. Since the
rule depended on the honor system, the competitor’s word
outweighed observations by others. This incident, more
than any other, led to the change in penalties for hitting
a racing mark. No longer must a crew retire or be dis-
qualified. Now they may reround the mark after hitting it.
This incident is, however, also symptomatic of both a
gradual deterioration of the moral fiber of society and a
changing attitude toward the importance of winning.
Many today seem to believe that winning is more impor-
tant than abiding by the rules. One youngster at an Opti-
mist Pram championship was asked why he had brought
two rudders. His unabashed reply was that the second one
was designed for sculling when the wind is light. Sculling,
the rapid back-and-forth movement of the rudder to pro-
pel the boat forward, is clearly illegal, but it is in wide-
spread use in smaller dinghy-type sailboats. Also illegal is
rocking (rolling the boat from side to side), pumping
(trimming the sails rapidly and easing them slowly), and
ooching (moving crew weight forward and aft). Some of
the foregoing are legal when used to promote surfing or
when, under a rules option, the race committee raises a
prescribed signal, but they are being used as a way to
propel the boat around the race course in light air in
flagrant violation of the rules.
Furthermore, one rule states that the boat must be pro-
pelled by the natural action of the wind on the sails. A
method of tacking, called “roll-tacking,” was originally
developed to improve the speed a small boat could carry
through a tack. It was soon discovered that roll-tacking,
done with precision and intensity numerous times in suc-
cession, could propel a dinghy upwind in light air far
faster than normal sailing. The same holds true for con-

-- 13 of 136 --

stant jibing. It was common knowledge that a good, solid
pull on the mainsheet in light air during a jibe would scoot
a light boat forward faster than just letting the boom come
across on its own. Some years ago I was crewing a Thistle
in the midwinters at St. Petersburg Yacht Club. We were
sailing toward the finish line downwind in first place with
the second place boat’s bow even with our transom. Sud-
denly he did two fast, violent jibes, which propelled him
to a first-place tie with us. Though we felt this was morally
wrong, his argument was that he decided to go for the
other end of the finish line and then changed his mind. It’s
easy to find some justification for a series of jibes or tacks.
This situation, though, has become exaggerated, with
some competitors in dinghies doing fifteen to twenty roll
tacks from the starting line to get ahead of the others.
The result is that dinghies can now be taken off the list
of tactical boats. If one tacks to cover another, the latter
can, by rocking, pumping, sculling, unweighting (bounc-
ing up and down), or torquing (bearing off, heeling, and
hiking out hard as you come back up to course), nullify the
effectiveness of the cover. All of these maneuvers are es-
sentially illegal, but are widely used.
How far should a sailor go to win? At a recent regatta it
was discovered a number of boats were sabotaged.
Spreader bolts had been sawed halfway through so that a
heavy wind would cause masts to be lost. The hope was
that vandals had done the damage because no one could
believe another competitor could or would stoop so low.
The truth has not yet been uncovered.
A few years ago two teenagers were racing a small cen-
terboard boat. After numerous capsizes in heavy winds
one of them could no longer get back into the boat after
righting it. He slipped away and drowned. It was discov-
ered that they had been carrying lead weights in their
pockets to make them heavier for hiking out in total con-
travention of the rule against movable ballast.
Just before the start of an ocean race in England in 1971,
an Italian yacht, late for the start, was powering at full
speed toward the starting line with only a minute to go

-- 14 of 136 --

What Are Tactics? if
before the gun. We raised a protest flag since she should
have turned off her engine, or at least gone into neutral
gear, five minutes before the start. More surprising than
the rule infringement was their reaction to our protest.
They couldn’t believe it, as if they considered the rule a
minor one made to be broken. One wonders if they also use
their engine on the race course when it’s calm and there’s
no other yacht around to spot them.
These have been examples of incidents that are clearly
illegal. The problem is that propulsion such as “pumping”
is becoming considered more immoral than illegal. That
justifies its use in many racer’s eyes because winning can
be considered more important than insignificant morals.
Let’s assume that we are dealing with totally legal tac-
tics in this book. There is still a whole set of tactics used
both on and off the race course that are both fascinating
and effective. I refer to psychological tactics. All sports use
them and sailing is no exception.
Let’s say you are being closely covered by another boat,
and you want to split tacks with him. Yet every tack you
make is matched by the other boat either on your wind or
close to it. Just keep tacking. Never give up after two tacks
because you think he’s going to match every tack you
make. Usually you’ll break away after the third tack. He
decides that a tacking duel with you is not worth the dis-
tance lost to other boats. If yours is the only boat he needs
to beat in a series, he may hold on longer, but usually three
tacks is the magic number.
There are some psychological tactics used off the race
course. Before a big series, when most everyone is nervous
to some degree, competitors often bait one another. One
might comment how tired another looks; one crew mem-
ber might try to get a rival skipper drunk the night before;
a competitor rubs a funny-looking potion from an un-
marked bottle on the bottom of his boat before launching
and claims it reduces skin friction 30 percent, and so on.
Bantering designed to put a competitor on guard or to
break his concentration on the racing is a reasonable psy-
chological tactic. After one race in the Rolex Regatta in

-- 15 of 136 --

the U.S. Virgin Islands aboard my fifty-four-foot ocean
racer, Sleuth, the skipper of another yacht came up to me
and said, in mock seriousness, that he was protesting me.
He said since we touched bottom off the tip of a two-mile-
long island that was a mark of the course, and failed to
reround the mark (the island) after touching it, we would
be disqualified. Thinking fast, I responded that there is a
rule and an appeal on the subject that states the underwa-
ter part of a mark is not considered part of the mark. A
yacht can touch the ground tackle, for instance, and not be
required to reround.
In another example, the legendary Arthur Knapp was
being beaten to the finish line by a particularly nervous
skipper in first place who kept looking back to see if
Arthur was gaining. Every time he looked back Arthur
slapped the side of the boat or spun a winch. This rattled
the skipper ahead enough that Arthur squeaked across the
finish line in first place.
Another tactic along this line described by Arthur
Knapp was that of a very good downwind skipper who
would engage nearby skippers in conversation to distract
them from steering well. He had no trouble talking and
steering so he invariably gained.
During an SORC race, Heritage was to leeward of Sleuth
without luffing rights on a reach. They came up, were
blanketed, fell off, and tried unsuccessfully to break
through farther to leeward. They came up again, and tried
to distract me with a great deal of shouting and close quar-
ters maneuvering off our lee rail. They yelled that I was
illegally coming down on them even though I was steering
a steady compass course. I called back that if they luffed
me once more they were ending up in a protest meeting,
and then ignored them to concentrate on steering. They
shortly dropped back, and went to windward of us past our
stern.
After finishing races some skippers sail very hard to
demoralize others. If a skipper and crew appear to be so
fresh after a long, grueling race, what fantastic physical
shape they must be in, and how can they be beaten in the

-- 16 of 136 --

next race? During the 1976 Olympic Trials I saw Dennis
Conner and Con Findlay planing back to the harbor in a
fresh breeze with spinnaker set after a race. Con was flat
out on the Tempest’s trapeze, pumping the spinnaker
sheet, and Dennis was aggressively playing every wave
and hiking out hard in every gust. Their competitors must
have been impressed at the strength, agility and intensity
of the two. It certainly could mean a difference in a head-
to-head confrontation in the next race.
There are other tactics that are simply practical jokes,
and if you are taken in by them, you should kick yourself.
A large nut with a cotter-pin hole in it is laid near the base
of the mast of an ocean-racing yacht before a race, and a
crew member discovers it. A panicky search for the bolt
from which the nut fell off is initiated. A man is sent aloft
in a bosun’s chair to inspect the mast, and energy is ex-
pended over this one nut, which detracts from race prepa-
ration.
During a Mallory Cup eliminations we switched boats
with another crew for a second race, as is common prac-
tice in this type of round-robin series. The spinnaker ap-
peared to be prepared, neatly packed in its container as if
the previous crew had forgotten they were to switch boats.
Our skipper was a little smug that a competitor was so
“out-to-lunch” as to do our work for us. Since the foredeck
was my responsibility, I wasn’t about to set a spinnaker I
hadn’t packed, so I dumped it out of the container. Under-
neath the neatly folded covers of the sail on top, the spin-
naker was tied in knots. Though I can’t imagine doing that
to another competitor, I only have myself to blame if I’m
taken in by such shenanigans.
We'll cover more psychological tactics later in conjunc-
tion with specific areas of the race course, but now let’s
turn to some of the more usual tactics sailors use.

-- 17 of 136 --

2. The Start
Without doubt, the most important contribution to the
final result of a sailboat race is the start. There are three
prime ingredients in making a good start: (1) to be on the
line at the instant of the starting signal, (2) to be at the best
location on the line, and (3) to have clear air. These three
components guarantee a good start, but they are far more
difficult to achieve than one may realize.
The first involves a sense of timing. There are usually
ten minutes in the starting sequence. Under one system, a
white warning signal goes up ten minutes before the start,
and comes down six minutes before. At five minutes, the
blue preparatory shape goes up, and at one minute before
the start it comes down. At the start a red shape is dis-
played. Most crews use a stopwatch to keep track of the
time elapsed, but I’ve also heard of people using a tape-
recorded countdown. Of the two types of stopwatches,
sweep second hand or digital, the latter is fine if a crew is

-- 18 of 136 --

The Start iB
calling out the time remaining to you, but the sweep sec-
ond hand gives a much better feeling of time. It’s usually
best to have two stopwatches going in case one gets
stopped by accident. The person taking the time should
start the watch at the signal rather than the gun. Often
when the starting line is long, the signal cannot be seen at
the moment it goes up, and the smoke from the gun must
be used. The noise from the gun will take too long to reach
you to be reliable for timing. If you miss the timing, be
sure to get it when the shape comes down.
Keep track of the color of the shapes and the order of the
start of the various classes. Otherwise you could miss your
start. Dick Deaver of North Sails once used a competitor’s
confusion over the starting sequence to his advantage. He
was in a match race series, pairs of boats racing against
each other, starting at ten-minute intervals. Dick was
paired against Australian Jim Hardy of 12-Meter fame.
For some reason, Jim thought the starting interval was
five minutes, and maneuvered himself into a very fine
position relative to Dick just before the five-minute gun.
Realizing that Jim was planning to start five minutes
early, Dick played along. He started along with Jim, but in
a very poor position. Dick then initiated a tacking duel to
make Jim really think that the race was on. By tacking
well, Jim was lengthening his lead on every tack. Eventu-
ally, at the 24% minute mark, with Jim Hardy well ahead,
Dick broke off the tacking duel, turned back to the line,
and started all alone at the correct signal. By the time Jim
figured it out and sailed back to start correctly, he was a
long way behind.
Dick emphasizes that Jim took it as a good sport, and this
incident shows that even the finest sailors in the world can
make mistakes.
Knowing the time remaining does not necessarily get
you to the line on time. In almost all sizes of tactical boats,
I find skippers sail too far away from the line to judge
accurately the time needed to get back. On Sleuth I use a
three-minute pattern. In other words, I’m near the line
with about three minutes to go for the start. After sailing
away from the line for roughly half the time remaining,

-- 19 of 136 --

12 The Yachtsman’s Guide to Racing Tactics
Ill still have over a minute on final approach. This is
enough time for even a fifty-four-footer to pick up speed.
Most other boats are using a longer pattern, four to six
minutes. They are coming back on starboard to start while
I’m still going away. If it looks to me that the first batch of
boats is very early, I just let them go by, and find a hole to
leeward and ahead of the group that appears to have
timed it correctly. If we all appear to be early as we ap-
proach the line, I have the option to luff them up to slow
the boat down. If, however, we’re all late, I have room to
fall off to drive the boat faster.
With a closehauled start, it’s important to know just
what heading you can make on each tack. Let’s say you
want to start on starboard tack at point A, as in Figure 1.
You have determined previously that you can sail 330°
closehauled on starboard. As you sail away from the line,
you take rough compass headings on the committee boat.
If you find that the bearing has changed from 020° to 350°
Figure 1

-- 20 of 136 --

The Start 13
too quickly, it means you will pass the 330° course well
before you need to jibe or to tack back for the line. This
will possibly place you in a dangerous barging position
(for an explanation of barging, see page 25). Fall off to run
more parallel to the 330° course, to converge with it more
slowly. You are now sailing farther away from the line, so
you will have to turn back earlier than before to cover the
greater distance involved. In addition, you will have to
adjust your course for other boats to avoid having them
either directly to windward of you when you return or on
your leeward quarter, where they can force you over the
line early. All these course adjustments mean changes in
your timing. For me, it is easier to judge the time it will
take to cover a short distance than a long one, which is an
additional reason for a three-minute pattern. In smaller
boats, which accelerate more rapidly, the pattern may be
even shorter. (In dinghies and catamarans, there is hardly
a discernible time pattern. You just choose your spot on the
starting line, sit there with sails luffiing until seconds be-
fore the gun sounds, trim in and go.)
The pattern, correctly undertaken, will get you near the
line at the gun. The next problem is to know how close to
the line you are. There is often a large sag in a string of
boats starting, for skippers often judge the location of the
starting line by their relation to other boats. Consider the
skipper of boat A in Figure 2 (on page 14). He looks toward
the race committee boat, and thinks that two competitors
are right on the line to windward of him. A glance toward
the buoy makes him feel that the nearest boat to leeward
may be over the line early and is reaching off. The other
boats appear to be right on the line. The truth is that all
the boats are well behind the starting line. The skipper of
boat A is the victim of a mistaken sense of perspective,
since he cannot look at both ends of the line at the same
time.
The solution is to find a way to look in only one direction
to know how close you are to the line. This is done by
taking a range. The most common way is to line up the
starting line with a point on shore. Whenever I crew, I urge

-- 21 of 136 --

Figure 2
the skipper to get a range before the start. While sailing a
Soling series in Annapolis with an internationally known
skipper, I was having trouble getting the point across. He
said, “Okay, Steve, we’re on the line now, and the buoy is
lined up with that outer span on the Chesapeake Bay
Bridge.” My response was that even with the skipper’s
long and varied experience, he was only guessing that we
were on the line when he said so. We sailed around behind
the committee boat, and reaching toward it, we lined up
the starting line flag with the buoy. The true range was the
buoy in line with the inner span (see Figure 3). My skipper
was flabbergasted that he was so far off in his judgment.
The bridge was an ideal range, but you can use anything
along the shore, such as a roof or a tree. You must remem-
ber as you approach the line that your range was taken
from the cockpit. Allow for the fact that your bow will
reach the line before you are on the range.
The timing and distance from the line can be guessed by
how quickly the bearing changes along the shore. The
farther you are from the buoy, the slower the bearing
changes, as shown in Figure 4. If the bearing is changing
fast, be careful not to poke your bow over the line. If it’s
changing slowly, you can get quite close to the cockpit
range you took and still be safe.

16 The Yachtsman’s Guide to Racing Tactics
Always remember that the race committee may move
the buoy between starts of various classes, or may change
the position of the committee boat. Since it’s difficult to get
a range in the last five minutes before the start, watch to
see if the line is being changed. An outboard motorboat
puttering around near the buoy, a person in the bow of the
committee boat near its anchorline, general recalls in pre-
vious starts, or a bunching of the fleet at one end of the line
in earlier starts are all indicative that the line may be
adjusted, negating the range you took.
Often the race committee places a stake boat at the far
end of a long starting line to aid in calling the boats that
are over early and are blocked from the view of the com-
mittee boat (see Figure 5). If done properly, the stake boat
will anchor right on the extension of the line, and one
crew member will sight the line through a vertical pole or
mast as in Figure 6. You can use the buoy and the vertical
pole as a range. The delightful aspect of this range is that
it is already made for you.
At the committee boat end there also is a ready-made
range. One person sights the line from behind the vertical
mast or pole that constitutes the committee-boat end of the
line. If you are near that end, it’s very easy to tell if you are

on his line of sight. At the start of the 1979 Transatlantic
Race from Marblehead to Ireland, I reached up on star-
board tack to leeward of the fleet. Alliance, to windward,
could have possibly blanketed us, but she was killing
speed because the helmsman thought he was early. I could
see that the man “calling” the line was sighting far ahead
of our bow, and I pushed on ahead. This allowed me to hit
the line right at the gun, get the best start in the class, work
out in front of Alliance, and give the crew a good boost for
the start of a long race.
I feel a good start is very important psychologically. It
does the crew a world of good to feel they have won the
start. They will work twice as hard to maintain their ad-
vantage. It’s “cotton mouth” time for me, as we are ma-
neuvering with other large yachts in close quarters. The
damage that could be done in a collision between boats
from fifty to eighty feet long is fearsome. Their power and

-- 25 of 136 --

momentum is tremendous. At the start in the next to last
race of the 1979 Antigua Race Week, I was sure Sleuth’s
number was up. The buoy end was favored. As we ap-
proached the line, the seventy-nine-foot Kialoa, along
with two other “maxis,” Mistress Quickly and Condor of
Bermuda, was overtaking us at twice our speed. Kialoa
came within two feet of hitting our starboard quarter. As
she headed up to avoid us, she collided with Mistress
Quickly, and went over the line early. Sleuth was being
held up by a boat to leeward, and there was no place we
could have gone to avoid the mess. Because so many boats
were over the line early, there was a general recall signal,
and we had to go through the whole procedure again in the
20-25 knots of wind prevailing at that time. My first reac-
tion was to thank God we hadn’t been hit or had someone
hurt. My initial plan for the restart was to be cautious and
conservative. It then occurred to me that every other skip-
per must be feeling the same way, and I resolved to “go for
it” on the restart. The buoy end was still the place to be,
and we were there right at the gun. As I suspected, we were
all alone and had the best start.
If you’re on a Starting line where there is no land or stake
boat for a range and you're starting near the middle of the
line, there’s still a way to help you judge the distance from
it. Before the start get the compass bearing of the line. Sail
out beyond the line. Then sail toward the buoy, lining it up
with the flag on the committee boat. On port tack, as in
Figure 7, the bearing is 100°. It follows that the bearing on
starboard is 280°. There are times when we are reaching
along the line on starboard tack to avoid going over early.
If we sail a course of 280° and the buoy is off our starboard
bow (as in Figure 8, position A), we’re still short of the line,
and can afford to get closer. If the buoy’s to port (as in
Figure 8, position B), we’re already over, and had better get
down to the proper side before the gun goes.
The best starting skippers are those who have complete
control over their boats. They know its turning radius so
that they can swing around the stern of another boat. They

know how fast they can stop the boat by backing the main-
sail, and how much lee helm this will give them. They
know how fast they can accelerate to avoid a windward
boat from driving over them. I once watched Arthur
Knapp at the start of a “frostbite” race in dinghies. He

-- 27 of 136 --

20: The Yachtsman’s Guide to Racing Tactics
placed his boat right at the committee-boat end of the line
in about 12-15 knots of wind. By trimming, luffing, moving
his weight, raising and lowering his centerboard, and ju-
dicious helmsmanship, Arthur was able to keep his
dinghy within three feet of the same location. Boat after
boat tried to hang in there with him, but drifted off to
leeward. At the gun he took off with the best start.
There still comes a time when no matter how good your
timing or ability to maneuver your sailboat is, you get
caught in a bind, and can’t avoid going across the line
early. For example, you may want to luff up to kill your
speed, but the committee boat or a number of individual
boats are in the way and thwart your intentions. You may
then decide to run down along the line, but some leeward
boats are there holding you up. There is no way to avoid
being early. This generally happens when the starboard
end is well favored, and boats are approaching almost at
right angles to the line. Instead of the port-end buoy’s
being well forward of abeam and only,a small dip needed
to keep from going over early, the buoy is actually almost
abeam, and a major alteration of course is necessary.
Aboard Sleuth in the 1980 Antigua Race Week race,
these same circumstances prevailed. We were early, with
Sunbird holding us up and nowhere to go. We could have
dipped a little or killed our speed a bit, but I knew that it
wouldn’t be sufficient to avoid being early since the buoy
end was so far back. So I plowed ahead, knowing we were
over early, but determined to round the committee boat as
fast as possible. We were closest to the committee boat
with Aries and Sunbird to leeward, all three of us going
for the line. They too were over early, and, possibly be-
cause they felt we were blocking the committee boat’s line
of vision, neither returned to start and both were dis-
qualified (Figure 9). Since our rerounding took only 35
seconds, it was not much more of a disadvantage than a
very poorly timed start. The key is to bite the bullet and
reround fast. If you kill your speed, even though you know
the start can’t be saved, two things can happen. First, those
who have timed it properly can drive over you to wind-
te

line to start on starboard tack. When the starboard end is
upwind, the reverse is true (see Figure 11). Tack, if possi-
ble. You’re going to have to go back to the line on port tack
anyway, and a tack takes you much closer to the favored
end.
There are a few other factors that can change your tim-
ing and mess up a perfect start. One is current; the other
is a change in wind strength. A combination of the two can
transform a small mistake into a disaster. When the
breeze is very light, the percentage of wind-strength
change can be great. A 2-knot breeze is doubled with a
4-knot puff, a 100 percent velocity change. A 15-knot wind
only increases 33.3 percent in a twenty-knot puff. Since
wind force on the sails quadruples as the wind velocity
doubles, you can see how important the puffs and lulls can

-- 30 of 136 --

Figure 11
be at the lower speed ranges. The problem in timing the
line often comes from a light wind that is dying. A boat
that strays too far away from the starting line in a light
breeze may end up in a hole, and take an hour to get back.
I’ve seen it happen. While all the other starters hugged the
line, one boat sailed to a point three minutes away from
the starting line in a light breeze. As luck would have it,
the breeze died where she was, but held near the line. By
the time she finally started, the fleet was rounding the
weather mark a mile away. The absolute rule for light air
is STAY NEAR THE LINE!
Since your competitors’ sails disturb and block the wind
more in light air than in heavy, you should avoid getting
into a large pack if possible. In some cases this is done by
initiating a “dip start.” Sail around to windward of the
line, particularly if there’s a current carrying you down-
wind. Just before the start, dip across to the correct side of
the line, harden up and start.
There are a few caveats to a dip start. The person spot-
ting the line for the race committee will see you on the
wrong side of the line before the start, may not have seen

-- 31 of 136 --

you completely clear the line if his attention is momentar-
ily directed elsewhere, and may call you over early when
he sees you in a good position right after the gun. More-
over, if you are reaching or running down on starboard
tack, all the boats to leeward of you have right of way
because, as windward boat, you must keep clear. Unless
you can find a hole, all the boats already on the line can
hold you up on the wrong side of it. For that reason, an
approach on port tack is often better than starboard. In
Figure 12, boat A on starboard tack is unable to find a hole,
and ends up running parallel to the line with boats hold-
ing her to the wrong side. Boat B on port tack sails against
the flow of starboard tack boats, and is able to select a hole
to jibe or tack into.
With current setting you downwind, this type of start
makes even more sense. If you sail around upcurrent of
the line and the wind dies, you will drift across to the
wind
f

The Start 25
proper side, and still be upwind of your competitors who
have drifted even farther downwind of the line. You are in
the same relationship to the other boats as before, but it’s
as if the line moved upcurrent as the fleet was pushed
downcurrent (see Figure 13).
Ae
Figure 13
If you want to start at the starboard end of the line with
current carrying you downwind, a “barging start” can be
relatively safe. By “barging” we mean placing yourself in
a position where a leeward boat can luff you into a starting
mark. In this example (see Figure 14 on page 26), let’s stick
to the starboard end with the committee boat there, since
with windward starts and marks left to port, that’s the way
the line is usually set up. The “anti-barging rule” states:
“When approaching the starting line to start, a leeward
yacht shall be under no obligation to give any windward
yacht room to pass to leeward of a starting mark sur-
rounded by navigable water... .” In Figure 14, boat A is on
a closehauled course to the committee boat end of the line.
Though it is commonly accepted that boat C is barging

-- 33 of 136 --

wind
Figure 14
B
because she is reaching in from an area above the close-
hauled course (indicated by the dotted line), boat A is also
barging because boat B, with luffing rights, can deprive
her of room at the committee boat until the starting signal
is made (at which time boat B must not sail above close-
hauled, or above the first mark to deprive boat A of room).
Figure 15 shows what the result might be a few seconds
later, before the gun.
With current set (see Figure 16), however, it’s far more
likely that boat C will find room. Whereas boats A and B,
being closehauled, can’t point any higher to adjust for the
contrary current, boat C is far more flexible, and can head
up from her reach right to the end of the line, leaving boat
A with no chance to squeeze C out.
When current is running in the opposite direction (see
Figure 17 on page 28), carrying the fleet toward the starting
line, the reverse is true. There can be an awful mess of
boats near the line, all being pushed over early by the
current and by leeward boats reaching down the line in an
attempt to avoid going over early. In:this case the most
leeward boat can get, if not the best, at least the safest start.
There are various methods to determine the velocity and

direction of the current. Observe the committee boat or
other anchored yachts to see if they are heading straight
into the wind. If not, there is some current running. This
observation is fine in light winds, but will not be discern-
ible when the wind is heavy. A better alternative is to sail

-- 35 of 136 --

wind
Figure 17 AR current
near the buoy end of the line, and to observe the water
flowing past the mark. The mark will appear as if it were
being dragged upcurrent, and it will create a wake behind
it when the current is strong. Look for impurities in the
water such as bits of paper, twigs, or even bubbles flowing
past. To be more scientific, drop a “current stick” into the
water next to the buoy. A “current stick” isa piece of wood,
or aluminum tube, weighted to float vertically. It is prefer-
able that it be equal in length to the draft of the boat. If so,
it will be affected by the same current affecting the boat.
The weight should be heavy enough to allow only a very
small portion of the stick to be above the surface of the
water. Thus the wind will not affect its travel to a large
extent. After dropping the stick, sail around for about a
minute, and then pick it up, noting how far and in which
direction it drifted from the buoy. Knowing that a nautical

-- 36 of 136 --

The Start 29
mile is roughly 6,000 feet and a “knot” is the speed neces-
sary to cover one nautical mile in one hour, we know that
a knot of current will carry the stick 100 feet in a minute.
If you are sailing a thirty-foot boat and judge that you’re
about three boat lengths (ninety feet) from the mark when
you pick up the current stick a minute later, you know that
the current is almost one knot. Moreover, you know the
rough distance you will have to allow for, to be on the line
at the starting signal if the current is carrying you away
from the line.
Up to now we’ve discussed windward starts. Timing lee-
ward (running or reaching) starts so that you hit the line
at the gun is slightly different and, in a way, more difficult.
The difficulty rests in that it can often be hard to slow
down if you’re early, yet it’s deadly to be late. Upwind you
can recover faster from a bad start by tacking for clear air
and playing wind shifts better than your competitors.
Reaching or running it can take “forever” to get past other
boats, even if they’re smaller, when they have had a better
start than you.
When the wind is in the direction shown in Figure 18,
my general tactic is to choose a point on the line where I’d
like to be at the gun. I then time it to be at that point on
a beam reach at roughly two minutes to go, providing
there’s a good breeze. Since it’s a reach, we pick up speed
very quickly after the turn to return to the line, so a shorter
time sequence can be used. With light winds I would use
a longer time sequence, because it takes longer to pick up
speed. I would also sail more downwind, more parallel to
the line, so as not to diverge from it very far and to make
our approach when returning a tighter reach for greater
speed. After reaching away from the line something less
than a minute, we jibe or tack and head back for an equal
amount of time.
The Vanderbilt timing system shown in Figure 18 on
page 30 could well be used in this instance. We cross the
line at two minutes (120 seconds) going away. We add the
time it takes to jibe or tack, say 20 seconds, and divide by
two (120+20=140~2=70). At the moment our watch says
there is a minute and ten seconds (70 seconds) left before

-- 37 of 136 --

2 minutes
to go

the start, we begin our tack or jibe. When we complete it,
the time remaining on the watch (50 seconds) is the same
as the time elapsed to the start of the jibe or tack. This is
probably made clearer by looking at Figure 18, which
shows the time remaining at various stages.
As we approach the line, we might find ourselves early.
By coming up toward the committee boat, as in position B,
Figure 18, we have to travel a longer distance to the line,
which helps eat up the time remaining. If the time is badly
misjudged, we can luff up higher, as in position C, and can
also slow the boat down by letting the sails luff, which we
can’t do when running. As long as we have an overlap on
a boat to windward, we can luff up along the line, and they
must respond. They cannot curtail the luff even if their
helmsman is forward of our mast, unless we luffed above
a closehauled course, which is not very likely under the
circumstances. The windward boat can only curtail my
luff if an obstruction, a third yacht or other object, restricts
its ability to respond. Because of the anti-barging rule, the
committee boat doesn’t qualify as an obstruction or “other
object” in this example.
This brings us to the danger involved with our approach

\

if early. If we have chosen a point on the line too close to
the committee boat, and we have a number of boats to
leeward of us who are also early, we could run out of line
before the gun. We can’t bear off across the line, because
we will foul the leeward boats. Possibly we can luff up
behind the stern of the committee boat, but there’s bound
to be some “spoiler,” such as boat A in Figure 19, who is
trying to mess up the port tack starters by approaching on
starboard. Boat B is in big trouble, and I’1l leave the reader
to figure out how she gets out of it unscathed. The only
answer I have is: Don’t get yourself into that position in the
first place.
When the wind is far enough aft, so that the starboard
tack can be easily carried to the line (see Figure 20 on page
32), yet the port tack is the desired course after the start,
a good approach is that of boat A. As the starboard tack
vessel, boat A has right of way. She converges with the
other boats, and, if necessary, she can head up to avoid
being over early. Just before the starting signal, she can
jibe to port, placing herself advantageously to windward
of all the others.

CHOOSING A STARTING LOCATION
We have covered the first ingredient of getting a good start,
being on the line at the instant of the.starting signal. The
second is to be at the best location on the line.
With a few exceptions, it pays to be at the favored end
of the line. By “favored” I mean the upwind end of the line .
for windward starts. Most sailboats start a race on star-
board tack, which gives them right of way over any boat
on port tack. When the line is absolutely square to the wind
direction, as in line A, Figure 21, a windward boat with
slightly better timing than a leeward boat should have no
trouble driving over the top (passing to windward) of the
leeward boat. This gives a slight advantage to the wind-
ward boat, and means more boats will bunch up at the
starboard end of the line to secure a windward location. By
moving the buoy up to position B in Figure 21, the leeward
boats are less overlapped by the windward boats and
thereby less disadvantaged. A slight cock of the port end
of the line to windward will tend to spread the boats more
evenly along the full length of the line, and will limit
congestion in any one area.
However, if the port end is well upwind as in Figure 22,
any boat starting at the buoy will have a great advantage

over one starting at the committee boat. Assuming two
boats can sail within 45° of the wind at the starting signal
and each starts sailing upwind on opposite tacks toward
the other, Figure 22 shows how far ahead the port tack
boat will cross the starboard tack boat. The line is only
thirteen boat lengths long, the wind is 30° off of square, and
boat A already has a six-length lead over boat B. In this
case the buoy end is “heavily favored.”
What happens if the windward mark is way to the right,
and there is a shorter straight-line distance to the mark
from the starboard end of the line than from the port, the
upwind, end? In Figure 23, an arc described from the
windward mark through the committee boat clearly
Figure 23 B
&

-- 42 of 136 --

The Start 35
shows that the buoy end is farther away from the wind-
ward mark. But the wind still favors the buoy end so much
that when boats A and B have both covered six units of
distance, boat A has retained a commanding lead. A few
assumptions are made here: that there is no difference in
the speed of the boats, that there are no wind shifts and
that there is at least one tack involved in the weather leg.
If it were just a reach from the starting line to the weather
mark, then the shortest geometric distance would proba-
bly be the fastest route to take.
Given that we want to be at the favored end, how do we
tell which end of the starting line is favored? My prefer-
ence is to determine the compass bearing of the line as we
did in Figure 7 by lining up the buoy with the starting line
flag on the committee boat. Let’s say we get 135° for the
line. If the line is absolutely perpendicular to the wind, as
in Figure 24, by subtracting 90° we get a wind heading of
45°. If, however, when we point the boat into the wind, the

wind
36 The Yachtsman’s Guide to Racing Tactics
compass reads 035°, the port end is 10° favored. If it reads
060°, the starboard end is 15° favored.
When you shoot into the wind to check its direction,
make sure the boat comes to a complete stop. In light air
the boat’s momentum will carry a long way, and the wind
will appear to be dead ahead while the boat is moving
forward. Only when this forward movement has ceased
can you accurately determine the true wind direction. The
sails, particularly the jib (if it doesn’t overlap the mast)
will luff right over the centerline of the boat when the
wind is dead ahead.
The advantage of the compass system is that you can
check the wind direction a distance from the line in undis-
turbed air, away from other classes that are starting, and
still know which end of the line to play when it’s your turn
to start.
This also has advantages over another system com-
monly used: checking the wind when right on the line and
noting toward which end your bow points. Since the bow
of the luffing sailboat A in Figure 25 is pointing more
toward the buoy than the committee boat, the buoy end is
upwind and favored. Boat B does the same thing from an
extension of the line and sights abeam. If the committee
boat is forward of abeam, the starboard end is favored; aft
Figure 25
&

-- 44 of 136 --

The Start oy
of abeam the port end is upwind. The advantage B has
over A’s system is that B knows when he is right on the
line, and has to sight only in one direction. Boat A has to
guess when she’s on the line, and has to sight in both
directions. If the wind’s angle from square is very slight,
B is more apt to pick it up accurately.
If you shoot the wind and find one end of the line very
much favored, consider the possibility that the race com-
mittee might be doing it on purpose. For example, there
may be a known geographical wind shift near some land
on the right side of the course, as depicted in Figure 26.
Most sharp competitors know that if they tack immedi-
ately after the start, they will be gradually headed on port
tack as they approach the shore. After tacking they will get
a starboard tack lift along the beach. Since the race com-
mittee doesn’t want a whole pile of hot competitors sailing
at their transom at the start, they place the buoy end way
upwind in order to coax a large portion of the fleet to start
at that end. It is very tempting, because, at least initially,
a boat at the buoy end has a decided advantage over one
at the other end. However, as the boats sail into the new
wind, that advantage is lost, and the boat that gets into the
new wind first gains the most distance. Note that boat A on
starboard tack in Figure 26 on page 38 crosses boat B near
the shore. She never would have crossed boat B if she had
taken starboard tack from the starting line.
If it looks as if there will be a large bunch of boats start-
ing at the starboard end, and it’s necessary to get on port
tack to reach the wind shift, only the one or two boats
nearest that end will get a good start. The others will have
to sail on starboard away from the shift until the wind-
ward boats tack. This being the case, a boat that ap-
proaches the line late, but right behind the boat nearest
the mark, will get the second or third best start in the fleet.
She will be clear to tack as soon as she passes the commit-
tee boat, assuming it’s at the starboard end of the line.

far to the left as it’s ever been, and is due to shift back now.
In other words, the boat with the perfect start at the buoy
is sailing in a header rather than a lift, and, worse yet, is
pinned on that tack by other starboard tack boats.
In Figure 27, boat A approaches the line on port tack,
picks a hole between a number of boats, scoots through,
and starts on port, sailing in a lift in clear air. As soon as
the heading shift comes back, she tacks to starboard, and
has the rest of the fleet beaten. Boat B, with the best start

There are some excellent sailors, like Peter Barrett,
Olympic gold medalist, who use port tack approaches on
almost every start. Whereas the starboard tack boat has to
hold her course, except to assume a proper course to start,
the port tack boat has greater flexibility. She just has to
avoid the starboard tack boats, and can choose an opening
to tack onto starboard for her own approach. A pure port
tack start is rare, but a port tack approach is fairly com-
mon and reasonable. The former works best when the port
end of the line is so favored that boats can barely cross it
on starboard tack. Line A in Figure 28 on page 40 is such
a situation. The port tack boat will have little trouble

-- 47 of 136 --

wind
Figure 28
crossing the starboard tackers, because they are almost in
a straight line bow to stern. The port tack boat in line B
where the wind is almost square will have major problems
crossing, and will probably have to tack.
Weigh a port tack start very carefully. Instant disqualifi-
cation isn’t a very good way to start a race. Moreover, the
port tack may be taking you away from a more desirable
area. In one recent race, I considered a port tack start
because the port end was well upwind. However, there
was a nearby shore with shallower water, less current, and
usually a port tack lift. Since we had to get to that shore
on starboard anyway, I decided to save a tack and to start
on starboard (see Figure 29). Also, the committee boat was
at that end, which makes a port tack start there more
dangerous. If you are forced to tack by a starboard tack
yacht, you can’t avoid hitting the committee boat. Aries,
with Lowell North steering, made a perfect port tack start,
and barely squeaked across Sleuth on starboard. We car-
ried into the shore, got slightly headed, and tacked. When

-- 48 of 136 --

Figure 29
we converged with Aries again we crossed her handily,
having taken a short-term disadvantage for a later gain.
Buddy Melges, Olympic medalist, Star and Soling world
champion (among other championships), says, “Put your
head one hundred yards in front of your boat.” In effect,
that’s what we were doing.
In Antigua Race Week, Sleuth and Aries seemed to have
somewhat comparable speed upwind. At the start of an-
other race, I elected not to try for the ideal position right
at the committee boat, because the starting line was closer
to shore than in the preceding example (see Figure 30 on
page 42). I estimated that we would have to tack so early
after the start to avoid going aground that we wouldn’t be
able to clear starboard tack boats, and we might be forced
back in toward shore. So we played the start a little farther
down the line. As we approached the shore, Aries called

for water. She had to tack to avoid going aground, and
couldn’t without fouling us. We tacked at her request as
required by the racing rules, and she tacked immediately
(also as called for by the rules). This put her right in
Sleuth’s backwind. As we both came out on port tack,
Aries, slowed by our dirty air, failed to cross Fandango on
starboard (just the position I was worried about getting
into at the start), and was disqualified. This is another
example in which possible future situations weigh in your
decision where to start on the starting line.
Sometimes it’s important not only to decide where on the
line you will start, but also where you will practice. Arthur
Knapp found that novice racing sailors were always

-- 50 of 136 --

watching him and starting where he started. This was
getting tiresome, so he’d make practice starts at the wrong
end of the line and draw all the neophytes to that area. At
the last moment he’d hightail it to the preferred end, and
start with less congestion. Naturally, he had timed how
long it would take to sail from one end of the line to the
other. This is good information to have in case you need to
change ends.
Another reason it’s beneficial to know the length of the
line is to help in your judgment of distances. The two ends
of the line are the only fixed points around the starting
area that can give a time-distance reference. Suppose it
takes three minutes to sail from the buoy to the committee
boat. If you’re one-third of a line length away from the line
as you approach to start, you are approximately one min-
ute away. You just have to make allowances for boat speed,
which could have been faster reaching along the line than
on the final approach.
STARTING WITH CLEAR AIR
The

by

	It
is
a
vital factor.

positions.
Boat

is
said
to
have
a
“safe

position
on
boat
B.
The wind

sails
so
that
the

	of
A
is
slightly
more

	Thus

header, and
	is
unable
to

because
	of the

It’s

getting to E in any usable form. What wind there is will be
turbulent, and boat E is in an untenable position.
Just after the start only the boats that are not affected by
others will move out. It’s obvious from Figure 31 that for
every boat with clear air there are quite a number of oth-
ers being hurt. The tactic required is usually either to tack
away, as boat C should do, or foot away to leeward, as boat
E might consider doing. A boat in D’s position must do
something drastic such as luffing her sails and dropping
back fast to tack. It’s slow death to just “hang in there.”

3. Starting Rules
Let’s touch on some of the rules that are in common use
before the start. We will paraphrase and leave portions out
that aren’t of immediate interest to the discussion, so refer
to your rulebook for the full text of the rule. You can get
acopy of The Yacht Racing Rules by writing to the United
States Yacht Racing Union, Inc. P.O. Box 209, Newport,
Rhode Island 02840.
One of the more confusing rules is “luffing before start-
ing” since it ceases to apply after a boat has started and
cleared the starting line. A yacht “starts” when, after the
starting signal, any part of her hull, crew, or equipment
first crosses the starting line in the direction of the course
to the first mark. She hasn’t “cleared” the line until every
part of her has completely crossed the line. Only then does
the “luffing after starting” rule apply.
Before the start, the leeward boat cannot luff a wind-
ward boat above a closehauled course if her mainmast is

aft of the windward boat’s helmsman. In Figure 32 boat A
is luffing along the line. Boat B overtakes her to leeward
and initiates a luff. (To luff in this context means altering
course toward the wind.) Boat B’s luff forces boat A to alter
course to avoid a collision. The luff must be carried out
slowly and in such a way as to give boat A room and oppor-
tunity to keep clear. If boat A turns upwind to avoid B and
her stern swings down and hits the leeward boat, she has
some justification in claiming that she wasn’t given
enough room and opportunity to keep clear. In this exam-
ple boat B is unable to luff above a closehauled course
since her mainmast is aft of boat A’s helmsman.
In Figure 33, when boat A’s helmsman sights abeam
from his normal station, it is obvious that he is aft of the
leeward boat’s mainmast. Here, boat B can luff right up to
head to wind as in the diagram, but she still must luff
slowly and give room and opportunity for the windward
boat to keep clear. After the starting signal, boat B can
continue to luff boat A as long as the leeward boat is not
depriving the windward boat of room at a starting mark
(the anti-barging rule). In the incident depicted in Figure
33, the anti-barging rule does not apply.

wind
Figure 33
The ease with which a leeward boat can control you as
the windward boat makes it crucial that you protect your
lee quarter as you approach the line on starboard tack
unless you are late for the start. If you are killing your
speed and a boat attempts to get an overlap to leeward,
trim in your sails, get out in front of him, and duck off to
leeward. However, if you feel you have the start timed well
and you expect the leeward boat to charge on through and
run down the line without bothering you, just let him go.
If you expect to be early and you have room to luff head to
wind, keep in mind that no boat can luff you any farther
if you are head to wind already. Any boat to windward has
to keep clear because you are the leeward boat. Mast posi-
tion is not a factor unless you are altering your course
toward the wind. If you have already arrived at your head
to wind position, you are no longer in the process of carry-
ing out a luff, and windward boats (i.e., boats on your star-
board side, since you are still on the starboard tack) have
to keep clear.
As mentioned before, many skippers approach the bulk

-- 55 of 136 --

48 The Yachtsman’s Guide to Racing Tactics
of the fleet on port tack, find a hole to leeward of a group
of starboard tack boats, and tack into it. As you sail toward
the line on starboard, watch for any port tack skipper who
has his eye on that patch of open water to leeward of you.
Without breaking the rule on altering course, head down
at him. This will force the port tack boat to sail even far-
ther off the wind, closing the distance between the two
boats faster. If he still intends to tack, he will have to do
so earlier. Since you are reaching with good speed, you
should be able to drive over the top of the leeward boat,
which is going slowly after the tack. The altering course
rule provides that the right of way boat shall not so alter
course as to prevent the other boat from keeping clear, or
to obstruct her while she is keeping clear. If the starboard
tack boat changes course early enough and then holds a
steady course, she is not in contravention of this rule. This
alteration of course is one risk the port tack boat is taking
and should be aware of.
There are some rules that specifically don’t apply at
starts. One in this category is rule 42, “Rounding or Pass-
ing Marks or Obstructions.” A leeward boat on starboard
tack that is squeezing to round the port-end buoy as in
Figure 34, cannot call for buoy room to the windward boats
if the starting mark is surrounded by navigable water. If
she has luffing rights, she could make room for herself by
luffing the windward boats. But in the diagram as drawn,
the leeward boat only has an overlap (her mast is aft of the
windward boat’s helmsman), so she can luff no higher
than closehauled, a course she is already on. Being
squeezed out, her only choice is to pass on the wrong side
of the mark, make a circle and try again.
Let’s place the leeward boat in the position shown in
Figure 35. Here, boat A can presumably luff boat B head
to wind since her mast is forward of B’s helmsman. How-
ever, the helmsman of boat C is forward of A’s mast, so A
cannot luff above a closehauled course if the luff will
affect C. Rule 38.6 states that a boat shall not luff unless
she has the right to luff all boats which would be affected
by her luff.
A rule that could affect starting yachts is rule 43,
ne

ph es
Figure 34
Figure 35
“Close-Hauled, Hailing for Room to Tack at Obstruction.”
An obstruction is any object large enough to require a
yacht, when not less than one overall length away from it,
to make a substantial alteration of course to pass on one

side or the other. In Figure 36, the mark is an obstruction,
and windward boat B is not required to tack at leeward
boat A’s request. If A hails for room to tack, B must inform
her that she is not entitled to it. Being in a bind, A may hail
again, and, having received room to tack from B, must
retire or accept an alternative penalty when so prescribed
in the sailing instructions. If boat B refuses to respond to
A’s initial hail and then fails to fetch the mark herself, B
must retire or take an alternative penalty.
By definition, the ground tackle of a mark is not consid-
ered part of it. If the race committee boat has a long an-
chorline out in front of it, the obstruction created by the
anchorline is not part of the mark, and another section of
the rule applies. Boat A in Figure 37 does have the right to
request and to receive room to tack from boat B. She is not
allowed to hail and to tack simultaneously. Boat B has two
choices: she can tack at the earliest possible moment after
the hail, in which case boat A must start her tack before
boat B completes hers. If A cannot tack without colliding
with boat B, A must tack as soon as she can clear her. Boat
B’s second choice is to reply, ‘““You tack” to A’s hail if, in her
opinion, she can keep clear without tacking or after post-

-- 58 of 136 --

He
Figure 37 wind
B
poning her tack. In this case, boat A must immediately
tack; boat B must keep clear. The onus of satisfying the
race committee that she kept clear lies on boat B, which
responded, “You tack.”
Though we have been discussing an obstruction that is
the anchorline of a starting mark, this same rule applies
for all obstructions. An obstruction can be a vessel under-
way, such as a starboard tack sailboat or any object that
can be passed on one side such as a shoal.
The rule about hitting a mark applies at the start also.
A boat that touches a starting mark after she begins rac-
ing, which is from the time of her preparatory signal, or
causes a mark or mark vessel to shift to avoid being
touched must retire immediately, unless she alleges that
she was wrongfully compelled by another boat to touch it
or cause it to shift, in which case she must protest. (If the
other yacht accepts an alternative penalty as prescribed in
the sailing instructions, the protest is not necessary.) She
also has another choice. She can exonerate herself by com-
pleting one entire rounding of the mark, leaving it on the
required side, and thereafter re-rounding it or re-passing
it without touching it. The boat in Figure 38 on page 52 has
touched the buoy at the port end of the line two minutes
before the starting signal. Since she is racing from her

-- 59 of 136 --

_————
Figure 38
preparatory signal, generally five minutes before her
starting signal, she is liable to the provisions of the rule.
Had she hit the mark earlier, before her preparatory sig-
nal, she could have ignored it. The penalty rounding can-
not commence until after the starting signal, otherwise it
could hardly be considered a penalty. At the port end of the
line the buoy must be circled in a counterclockwise direc-
tion to leave the buoy on the required side, the port side,
for the weather leg. At the committee boat end the round-
ing has to be in a clockwise direction.
The rule on general recalls affects one’s tactics with
regard to where on the line to start. It reads, “... when after
a general recall, any part of a yacht’s hull, crew or equip-
ment is on the course side of the starting line or its exten-
sions during the minute before her starting signal, she
shall return to the pre-start side of the line across one of
its extensions and start.” General recalls occur when so
many boats are over the line early the race committee is
unable to identify them all. The only fair thing is to have
another start. To reduce the possibility of a second, third,
or even fourth general recall in a particularly aggressive
fleet, the rule above was devised. Commonly known as the
“around the ends” rule, it effectively keeps most of the
competitors away from the starting line before the start,
particularly near the center of the line. There, a boat that
was over early would have quite a long distance to
sail to get around the end of the starting line to start. This

-- 60 of 136 --

Starting Rules 53
rule also precludes doing a dip start, so be aware of it after
a general recall. Tactically, a conservative center-of-the-
line start can be an excellent one after a general recall
because all your competitors are bunching up at the ends
of the line to reduce the distance they have to sail if over
the line before the starting signal.

4. Wind Shifts on
the Weather Leg
After starting and clearing the line, the first weather leg
is of crucial importance. Boats are still relatively close to
one another, and the wind is chopped up by numerous
sails. Other than boat speed, which we are not including
in our discussion of tactics, the one major difference be-
tween skippers is how they play the wind tactically.
There are two basic types of winds. One tends to shift
back and forth, but maintains one mean direction. We call
this an oscillating wind. The:other wind has small shifts
back and forth, but the mean wind travels either clock-
wise (veering) or counterclockwise (backing). We call this
a continual shift. A study of meteorology will tell you what
type of wind to expect from a given weather pattern. The
oscillating shift is symptomatic of an unstable air mass—
cold air over a warm body of land or water. The warm air
near the surface rises and the cold, heavier air falls to the
surface. Because of surface friction and the rotation of the

-- 62 of 136 --

Figure 39
earth (Coriolis effect), the upper air in the northern hemi-
sphere is more usually veered than that at sea level. Ina
typical cool northwest wind, the upper air hits the surface
in gust cells that fan out as they travel along. On some days
the wind shifts caused by these gusts are quite regular and
can almost be timed. The skipper who tacks on every
header will easily outdistance those who sail through the
shifts or who are “out of phase” and tack on the lifts. Boat
A in Figure 39 tacks every time she is headed, and is al-
‘ ways sailing on a lifted tack. Boat B sails on one tack

-- 63 of 136 --

56 The Yachtsman’s Guide to Racing Tactics
through a lift, a header, a second lift, and a second header
before she tacks. We are assuming both boats sail within
45° of the wind, the wind shift is 20° each time, and they are
sailing at the same speed through the water. It is clear that
boat A has gained a commanding lead over boat B in a
relatively short distance.
The continual shift can be just as impressive if played
correctly. We touched on it briefly in choosing the end of
the starting line nearest the expected shift. The continual
shift is associated with a stable air mass. Southerly winds
bringing warm air over cooler water or land cause a strat-
ified condition as evidenced by smokestack emissions’
flowing parallel to the land rather than rising.
In Figure 40, boat B starts off in the direction toward
which the wind is expected to shift, and boat A sets out on
the other tack. Boat A gets lifted, feels good about it, and
continues on. At position 3 they both tack. Now boat A is
sailing in a header and boat B in a lift. The difference is
that A’s header is much worse than when boat B was sail-
ing in a header and B’s lift is much better than A’s original
lift. If A had gone much farther before tacking, she would
have lost far more distance. When you find yourself sailing
what we call “the great circle” in a continual lift, the
sooner the decision is made to tack to get over to the good
side of the course the more the losses are cut. It takes a
great deal of fortitude to do this, because it’s easier to hope
that the wind will shift back again, head you, and give you
a lift on the other tack.
Many sailors know the foregoing theory of wind shifts
very well, but have trouble spotting them on the race
course and remembering how to use them properly. There
are various ways to spot and to use windshifts. After long
experience some of the best sailors can tell a shift direc-
tion by the gust on the water. I’ve heard that Paul Elvstrom
and Hans Fogh (in preparation for the Olympics) worked
long and hard at guessing whether an approaching gust
(as outlined by dark ripples on the water surface) was a
header or a lift. After much practice they could determine
the expected wind direction with great accuracy.

-- 64 of 136 --

Figure 40 A B
Most of us rely almost exclusively upon the compass to
show us wind shifts. One crew member, usually the tacti-
cian, is assigned the job of watching the boat’s heading
while the skipper concentrates on keeping her in the
groove upwind. Some skippers like to hear “up/five” or
“down/ten,” meaning they are sailing five degrees higher
or ten degrees lower than the agreed-upon mean course.
Others prefer to hear the actual compass headings. If they
aresailing260° on the starboard tack and hear the num-

-- 65 of 136 --

58 The Yachtsman’s Guide to Racing Tactics
bers 265° and 270° called out, they know they are being
lifted. While higher numbers are good on starboard tack,
they are generally bad on port since they indicate a
header.
There are times when good skippers will ignore the indi-
cation of a header. For instance, when the wind velocity
decreases, the apparent wind goes forward. The skipper
will have to sail a lower course and has apparently been
headed. The true wind direction, however, has remained
the same. The best skippers, like Buddy Melges, have the
wind velocity totally cranked into their mental computers,
and don’t necessarily tack in headers if they are created by
wind-velocity changes.
A change in velocity can completely disorient the more
inexperienced skipper. The scenario is as follows: the boat
sails into a hole in the wind, and the apparent wind,
created by the boat speed, goes forward. Being “headed,”
the skipper decides to tack. As the boat turns into the wind
the sails fill because the apparent wind comes aft due to
the boat’s rotation. The skipper decides the header was
temporary and aborts the tack. By the time the boat settles
back down on the original tack, the boat speed has di-
minished considerably, the apparent wind is no longer
forward, and the skipper’s decision to abort appears
vindicated. Yet the true wind has never changed direction.
Only the velocity changed.
Another way of spotting headers and lifts, one that
doesn’t depend on the compass, is to observe the heading
of other boats. Boats A and B are abeam of each other in
Figure 41, position 1. Along comes a big header, as in posi-
tion 2, and boat B forges ahead. When a large lift comes,
as in position 3, it benefits the “inside boat,” boat A, the
most. The boats have won or lost great distances, but have
been moving through the water at exactly the same speed.
It’s obvious from the diagram that one wants to be the
leeward boat in a header and the windward boat in a lift.
But how is that possible? If, when headed, boat B tacks
while boat A continues on in an extended header, they
may very well change places, as shown by the dotted lines
in Figure 41. Then boat B is in position to take advantage

-- 66 of 136 --

wind
Figure 41
of the next lift, and boat A has ended up on the outside of
the lift, a very poor position indeed.
When the crew of boat B notices that suddenly in posi-
tion 2 they are looking very good on boat A, as if their speed
has greatly increased, they figure that something’s fishy.
Since such a jump in speed isn’t likely, they determine
they’ve been headed and tack. So without looking at the
compass they have been able to play the wind shift well.
Finn dinghy sailors and those who sail other single-
handed sailboats understand windshifts from boat rela-
tionships very well. Once I was sailing with Peter Barrett,
an Olympic medalist in the Finn class, and we were in the
position of boat B in Figure 42 on page 60. We were coming
up to a windward finish ahead. I felt we could just about
cross boat A if we tacked at position 1. I suggested to Peter
that we consolidate our position by getting to windward of
boat A and covering her. We both were laying the finish,
but boat A, with a lightweight crew, was moving much
faster in the light air we had. Peter kept on sailing on
-starboard for a few moments, and then said, “Now, let’s

-- 67 of 136 --

wind
et ae	—
	aoa ee

	-_—

tack.” At that time, in position 2, I looked back at boat A,
and saw we could cross easily. Since we were still laying
the finish line (a layline is an imaginary line indicating
the last tack to the windward mark) I wondered why Peter
had chosen to cover at a time when we looked so good. It
hardly seemed necessary now that we were handily beat-
ing boat A. Even if she caught up, she would have trouble
breaking through our backwind. In retrospect I realized
that we both had been slightly headed, and Peter was con-
solidating our lead by utilizing the lift on port tack. By
getting to windward of A, any future lift would not work
to our disadvantage as before, and there would be no
chance of our competitor’s passing us to windward.
Watch boats to windward of you on a beat. Headers and
lifts will hit them first, and as the shift is traveling down
to you, quite a bit of distance can be gained by using the
proper tactics. Boat A in Figure 43 sees that a boat to wind-
ward of her has been lifted, but A is still sailing in the
original wind. If A keeps on sailing, she will be in position

and thus head them. We noticed they were being headed,
and though we were not closehauled and could have
squeezed up ten to fifteen degrees, I decided to reach off
for speed. What happens is shown in Figure 44. The posi-
tion lines in the original wind are much farther apart than
the position lines in the new wind. This indicates how
much distance we caught up.
The tactic is apparent: When you expect a header, foot
(sail fast) for it. Figure 45 shows three boats equal to one
another in the original wind. Boat A sails closehauled
while B foots off for speed. When the heading shift arrives,
the new lines of position show that boat B has gained con-
siderably over boat A. Even if B remains closehauled (the
dotted lines in Figure 45), she would gain on A when the
shift arrives because she is closer to the side of the race

5. Covering,
Breaking Cover, and
Luffing
Often a skipper is concerned about only one other com-
petitor. On the last windward leg to the finish, it may be
the nearest boat. In the last race of a series, it could be the
competitor who is closest in points. Or perhaps it’s just the
perennial foe who is always nearby and forever hard to
beat. Many races are lost by not covering opponents when
the chance exists. A typical example occurs when a boat
on starboard tack crosses an opponent on port and fails to
tack to cover. If the finish line is nearby, sailing farther
before covering (“splitting tacks’) is a very risky business.
Any little wind shift can cause positions to change. The
proper tactic is to stay between your opponent and the
finish line, sailing in the same direction and, therefore, in

opponent from passing. In position A, one boat is dead
upwind of the other, and the leeward boat will have to sail
six units of distance to be in the same position as the wind-
ward boat. A large header comes, as in position B. The
leeward boat tacks immediately, and has only five units to
sail. In position C a large lift again puts the leeward boat
closer, this time by a little over five units. Smaller wind
shifts make the loss smaller, but it’s still there. It’s possible
to
anticipate and
to
minimize
	the loss if
you are fairly sure

-- 73 of 136 --

66 The Yachtsman’s Guide to Racing Tactics
what the next shift will be. If a header is expected, the
windward boat might tack a little earlier. By so doing,
more is gained by being more in front, rather than dead
upwind, of the leeward boat. However, you are vulnerable
to being hurt worse if a lift occurs instead of a header.
Covering an opponent has to be done with full knowl-
edge of his reactions. When you tack close dead to wind-
ward of another boat, he has no other choice but to tack
away to avoid the bad air from your sails. This means you
have to tack again to cover and possibly even again after
that, assuming your opponent keeps on tacking to get clear
air. There are many instances when such a tacking duel
does neither of you any good. It’s fine if you are match
racing, but in most other races you can lose places to other
boats by spending too much time covering your prime
competition. That’s when a “herding” type of cover is ap-
propriate. You want to go in the same direction as the bulk
of the other boats, for instance, so you cover your opponent
tightly, hurting his air when he is sailing away from the
others.
Boat A in Figure 47 has placed boat B in her wind
shadow. With the others on port tack, splitting tacks with
the fleet can be dangerous. When boat B tacks to get clear
air, boat A carries on for a short distance before tacking so
that B has clear air and no incentive to tack again.
Nonetheless, boat A is still between boat B and the finish.
In effect you are herding him in the direction you want to
go.
Another instance where covering an opponent too
closely is a disadvantage is when you are both sailing in
a lift. A tight cover will force him to tack, and by covering
you will also end up in the header.
To place a tight cover on another boat properly takes
timing and precision. The tack after crossing the opponent
must be made just at the right location and moment so that
you’re dead on his wind by the time you have picked up
momentum after the tack. Tack too late, and the other boat
will have a safe leeward position on you. Tack too early,

whereas

-- 75 of 136 --

68 The Yachtsman’s Guide to Racing Tactics
to an opponent’s tack. By watching the wave patterns, the
covered boat can choose an intermittent smooth patch of
water in which to accelerate rapidly after tacking. The
covering boat simply tacks upon seeing the leeward boat
tack, and is often in worse wave conditions.
Dick Stearns, a legendary Star sailor, worked over Tom
Blackaller in an interesting manner during a Bacardi Cup
Star Series. Though Dick had good boat speed, Tom was
well upwind and covering in the normal way. They had a
shifty offshore breeze of 15 m.p.h. Dick watched the hull
of Tom’s Star closely. When Tom appeared to be lifted,
Dick tacked. When Tom tacked to cover, he was now sail-
ing in a header. Since the wind shift took a few moments
to travel down to leeward, Dick had a few degrees of head-
ing advantage until the new wind reached him. By repeat-
ing this procedure over and over, Dick ate up Tom’s lead.
Sometimes you can cover from ahead and to leeward,
such as when there is less adverse current along a lee
shore. Bruce Goldsmith “covered” Gordon Lindemann
during a Soling Midwinters in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, by
footing toward the shore out of the current. Gordon’s style
was to point high, but pointing just kept him a longer time
in the current. By sailing fast but low, into less current,
Bruce could end up to windward and ahead of Gordon
every time around the course. Just as you should foot to
headers, foot also to areas of less adverse current.
Once a covering position has been established, the boat
being covered generally tries to break the cover—to get
free air and even to turn the tables, to become the covering
boat. One way already mentioned is to initiate a tacking
duel. If this tactic isn’t helping, try a false tack. If the
covering boat is starting his tack at the instant you start
yours, a false tack can sometimes work. Act just as if you
are planning to complete the tack, but abort it when head
to wind. The windward boat has completed his tack, and
has to gain speed before tacking back to cover. For a short
time you are on opposite tacks, which.should be sufficient
to break the cover. Frankly, the false tack never works in
top-flight competition because the covering boat will

delay tacking just long enough to force you to complete
your tack.
Another method is to lead the covering boat into an ob-
struction. The covering boat’s skipper is concentrating
more on the boat he wants to beat than on his surround-
ings. The skipper of the leeward boat can look around for
solutions to his problem because he is calling the shots as
to when the tack occurs. I saw a beautiful example of this
in the 1963 Pan American Games. Pat Duane was the
American Flying Dutchman National Champion. As the
series was drawing to a close, she and the Brazilian entry
were way out front of the other Flying Dutchman skip-
pers. Pat was being closely covered by the Brazilian to
windward in light air on the final beat to the finish line.
They were on starboard tack when Pat noticed the tail-end
boat of the Snipe fleet they were about to lap. He was on
port tack, to windward and ahead of her opponent. Know-
ing that the Brazilian would tack to cover her, Pat timed
her tack so that when he covered, he’d be sailing right
down the transom of the Snipe (see Figure 48 on page 70).
What happened next couldn’t have been foreseen by Pat,
but it clinched the lead for her. The Brazilian decided to
pass to windward of the Snipe, who at the same instant
tacked to get out of the way of the two leading contenders
for the Flying Dutchman gold medal. The Snipe was now
on starboard tack, which forced the Brazilian to tack over
on to starboard also to avoid fouling the Snipe. The two
Flying Dutchmen were now on split tacks, which broke
the cover. When Pat came back over on starboard tack
later, she crossed the Brazilian and won the race.

instance, they may be changing jibs, or may have fouled
up a jib sheet. If they are unprepared, or unable to tack,
that’s the obvious time to break the’ cover. It’s a simple
tactic, but one often overlooked. Many opportunities to get
away are lost forever when not seized at the moment.
One can even break the cover from a boat behind with
a little thought. A few years back I was crewing on Carina
in Long Island Sound. Toward the end of a two-day race,
we were “rock hopping” along the shore shortly after
dawn to pick up the light offshore breeze. We noticed that
Baccarat, about half a mile to leeward, matched every
tack we made to stay as close to shore as we were. The

-- 78 of 136 --

Covering, Breaking Cover, and Luffing 71
tacks weren’t random. They were covering from behind.
When we tacked toward shore, they also tacked. When we
tacked away from shore, they tacked at the same instant.
Feeling we could put such predictability to good use, we
started poring over the chart. We noticed in one area that
the ten-foot bottom contour took a long passage toward the
shore (Figure 49) so we sailed out on port tack until we
judged that Baccarat was opposite the channel. We
tacked, and, true to form, so did Baccarat. We then sailed
in as far toward shore as possible, and tacked when our
centerboard touched bottom. Baccarat tacked and

promptly went hard aground on an outgoing tide at the
“X” in Figure 49. We sailed away until she was out of sight
astern, still aground. Lest the reader feel we were some-
how playing with danger, let me reassure him that going
aground in mud along the Long Island shore is a common-
place occurrence, and no danger or damage is possible on
light days.
Dr. Stuart Walker, the great author of sailing books, told
me of a tactic he has used successfully to break a cover
almost before it happens. He worked this tactic sailing his
International 14 dinghy in a team match. A port tack boat
in a team match expects a crossing starboard tacker to
tack and to cover—either on her lee bow or on her weather
quarter. Stuart, in the port tack boat, bears off early to go
under the starboard tack boat. This forces the starboard
tacker to cross because a safe leeward is unobtainable. To
avoid obstructing the port tack boat, the starboard tacker
can’t start tacking to cover until the port tack boat’s bow
crosses her stern. Stuart, in the port.tack boat, tacks im-
mediately after she passes astern to meet the starboard
tacker tacking simultaneously. When two yachts are tack-
ing at the same time, rule 41.4 says the one on the other’s
port side shall keep clear. By using this tactic, the port tack
boat may force the other back onto starboard tack, as in
Figure 50, and drive over her.
This tactic seems to work best with dinghies, but has
been tried on boats as large as twelve meters. Dennis Con-
ner was skippering Freedom in the 1980 America’s Cup
Trials. While sailing on port tack, Freedom ducked under
Clipper on starboard tack near the layline. As Tom Black-
aller, helmsman of Clipper, tacked to pin Freedom, Den-
nis Conner started to tack simultaneously. However, Tom
just did a sweeping, slow tack and cleared Clipper’s bow.
Tom knew the rules, recognized the trap Dennis was try-
ing to lure him into, and adjusted his tactics accordingly.
Luffing is a common defensive tactic to prevent another
yacht from passing to windward. Because this tactic is
rarely used when beating, it tends to be forgotten as an
option. There are times when a good luff on a beat can be
tactically rewarding. For instance, you are approaching

	as

-- 81 of 136 --

74 The Yachtsman’s Guide to Racing Tactics
to avoid being pinned to the layline. I don’t particularly
like the skipper who luffs in an attempt to “tag you out.”
The rules allow a sharp luff without warning, and if
there’s contact, the windward boat is usually either dis-
qualified or penalized. Some skippers use the rule to luff
all over the course without any apparent purpose except
catching the windward boat unawares. Generally, if you
are the skipper of a windward boat that is luffed and
tagged by a leeward boat, you should be annoyed at your-
self for putting your boat in such a vulnerable position,
rather than at the leeward skipper for exercising his
rights.
The one spot where the proximity of boats makes it diffi-
cult to avoid a sharp luff is right after rounding a mark.
Let’s say you have an inside overlap at a mark. The outside
boat gives you just enough room to allow you to round
safely. This puts you in closer than you would normally be
in case of a luff. Since you are placed in this vulnerable
position through no fault of your own, you must be partic-
ularly wary.
It was just such a situation that was the impetus for me
to learn the racing rules well. I was about sixteen years
old, and had borrowed my father’s Atlantic-class sailboat
for a Saturday afternoon race at my local yacht club. I was
approaching the leeward mark on a port tack run, and my
bow was almost overlapped with the stern of an older
member’s boat on starboard tack. He sailed right past the
mark without jibing. I swung inside and hardened up
around the mark, whereupon he jibed, luffed head to wind,
hit me near the stern about a boat length past the mark,
and yelled, “You’re out!” I disregarded the call and kept on
racing. Two weeks later the race committee chairman
said to me, “Stevie, an incident happened on the race
course a while ago, and the club cannot condone such
behavior.” I was taken before a protest committee and
thrown out of the race. I knew nothing except the basic
right of way rules, so I couldn’t defend myself. That night
I started studying the rulebook, and found that (1) the
protesting skipper hadn’t jibed at the first reasonable op-

-- 82 of 136 --

Covering, Breaking Cover, and Luffing 75
portunity, (2) he had luffed without luffing rights, (3) he
had failed to fly a protest flag, (4) the protest was not in
writing, (5) the protest was not made within two hours of
the finish of the race, (6) a reasonable time was not al-
lowed for the preparation of a defense, and so on, and so
on. I swore never to be so unprepared again.
I soon learned, in regard to luffing after starting, that a
leeward boat can luff only a boat that is passing to wind-
ward. A leeward boat cannot overtake to leeward and then
luff. If, at any time during an overlap, the helmsman of the
windward yacht is abeam or forward of the mainmast of
the leeward yacht, the latter shall not sail above her
proper course while the overlap exists.
When a boat does attempt to pass you to windward, you
can luff that boat head to wind if you desire. As two boats
turn toward the wind, however, the outside leeward boat
has farther to turn and so loses ground on the inside wind-
ward boat. If the leeward boat’s mast comes abeam of the
windward boat’s helmsman, he calls “mast abeam,” and
the leeward boat has to fall off to her proper course to the
mark. There are a few tricks that have been outlawed.
Windward’s helmsman must be in his normal steering
position, and cannot lean way forward so as to call mast
abeam earlier. Nor can he point the boat higher than the
leeward boat to get the same result. If leeward’s helmsman
feels the call of mast abeam has been premature or other-
wise improper, the only recourse is to protest. Further,
leeward’s helmsman can luff only if he has luffing rights
on all boats affected by the luff. Keep this in mind the next
time you are being luffed. I’ve often stopped a leeward boat
from luffing me because the helmsman of a boat to wind-
ward of me was forward of leeward’s mast.
There
are
other
ways
to
avoid being
luffed,
but one
of the
most interesting can be attributed
to Jim
Mattingly aboard
Tenacious.
	Many
	race circulars

have
	a
rule that limits luffing.
The wording

great
deal in
each

	to

sunset. At other times the International Rules of the Road
at Sea prevail. The idea is to prevent boats from having
dangerous luffing matches at night or out at sea.
Jim was tactician on Tenacious, and they were being
legally luffed by another boat. While the crew of the other
boat was yelling and screaming at Tenacious, Jim politely
asked if they had read their race circular. This distracted
them enough to send a man below for it and by the time
they figured out they did indeed have the right to luff,
Tenacious had slipped on through.

6. Laylines
A basic tactical rule of sailboat racing is “avoid the lay-
lines.” (The layline is an imaginary line indicating the last
tack to the windward mark.) If you make your last tack for
the mark a long distance from it, many of your options to
take advantage of wind shifts are lost. If you get lifted,
you’ve overstood the mark. This means you have sailed
above the new layline, and you will have to reach off for
the mark. If you get headed, you can no longer lay the
mark and must tack. Every boat closer to the mark gets a
greater advantage from a header than you do. In Figure 51
on page 78, boats A and B were even in the original wind
direction. When headed, they both tack and B has gained.
Moreover, A has only a short distance to sail before she
arrives at the new layline, and has to tack for the mark. If
the wind hasn’t shifted back, she will be sailing for the
mark in a header while B is still on a port tack lift. Boat

D was on the original port tack layline. But when the shift
arrives, boat C is now on the layline while D has overstood.
Another reason to avoid the laylines until a few boat
lengths from the mark is that each boat on the layline is
feeding bad air to the boat behind it. Unless you overstanda
little, the backwind from the boat ahead ‘could be sufficient
to slow you substantially. A slow boat makes more leeway,
which could result in failing to lay the mark. Many skip-
pers start to pinch the boat when this occurs, which results
in more leeway and virtually guarantees a problem at the
mark. The correct tactic is to sail fast and, if it’s close, shoot
dead into the wind to get around the mark. Release the jib,
especially a genoa, to avoid backing it.
When it becomes obvious that because of current, an-
other boat’s backwind, or whatever, there is no way to lay
the mark, look for a spot to tack early. Even if it’s neces-

-- 86 of 136 --

Laylines 79
sary to slow the boat down to let a windward boat pass, it
may be better than continuing on into an impossible situa-
tion. A windward boat will usually bear off for speed in an
attempt to take the leeward boat’s wind (to blanket her)
even if, by doing so, she fails to fetch the mark. This guar-
antees the windward boat the lead at the mark. If he had
allowed the leeward boat to pinch, or to shoot, to fetch the
mark, the latter would have an inside overlap, and would
probably maintain the lead.
For many reasons, therefore, it’s important to avoid
reaching the laylines too early. About the only disadvan-
tages in arriving at the starboard tack layline very close to
the mark are: (1) congestion, and (2) the short distance on
starboard tack to set up for a spinnaker. The first depends
on the size of the fleet, the length of the weather leg, and
the type of boats. A large, evenly matched fleet of identical
boats can result in a mammoth pack of starboard tack
boats approaching the weather mark for a port rounding.
A port tack boat may have to take fifteen or twenty sterns
before finding a hole in which to tack. On the other hand,
a boat in a class of cruising boats that have finished a
five-mile beat may find no other boat within 100 yards.
The second disadvantage is more important to the cruis-
ing boat. Because of the more cumbersome equipment,
such as heavy spinnaker poles, more time is needed to
prepare for a spinnaker leg than on smaller boats. One has
to approach the layline at a distance from the mark to
allow the crew time to set up, but not so far out that one
either overstands or otherwise misjudges the layline.
This brings us to the tactics involved in determining
when the layline has been reached. One common method
is to observe how other boats are heading on the opposite
tack as you pass their sterns. At the instant you cross an
extension of their centerline, you can determine if they
are pointing at the mark or not. Beware of the cagey skip-
per who, knowing you'll be checking, heads off ten degrees
or so below the mark just as you pass his stern. His change
of course is imperceptible to you, and it appears he is
unable to fetch the mark, which misleads you into sailing
farther and overstanding.

-- 87 of 136 --

80 The Yachtsman’s Guide to Racing Tactics
A variation on this theme is when the port tack boat is
crossing ahead of the starboard tack boat. Since the latter
is on the layline and doesn’t want the port tack boat to feed
her bad air all the way to the mark, she heads off about ten
degrees and maintains a constant course so as not to ob-
struct the port tack boat. When the opponent tacks in a
safe leeward position or dead in front of the starboard tack
boat, the latter heads up to closehauled and drives over the
top of the boat that just tacked.
By remembering your compass course the last time you
were on starboard tack, you can take compass bearings on
the mark, and tack when it bears the same as your last
reading on starboard. This assumes no windshifts or cur-
rent, but these can be cranked into your calculations. For
instance, if you’re sailing in a ten-degree header on port
tack, add ten degrees to your last heading on starboard
tack and use that for a bearing.
Skippers of many boats paint laylines on their decks
based on their normal tacking angles. Let’s say your boat
sails within 45° of the wind and tacks in 90°. A line painted
abeam (90° from the centerline of the boat) indicates the
layline. When the mark is on an extension of that line, a
tack will place you right on the layline. Often other lines
are added 45° forward and aft of the layline, as in Figure
52. The forward line shows whether you are ahead or be-
hind a boat to leeward. The aft line gives the same infor-
mation on a boat to windward. Of course, these lines only
work if there are no wind shifts, if you are steering an
accurate closehauled course, and if you have calculated
your tacking angles correctly. Since these are very big ifs,
such lines are used as rough aids rather than absolutes.
There are times when you may want to overstand the
layline. If a boat is ahead and to leeward of you on port
tack as you approach the starboard tack layline, you must
make sure she is unable to tack without fouling you (see
Figure 53). To that end, you bear off for speed, and get close
enough to windward of her that she can’t tack. With her
pinned in that position, you drive her past the layline to
the point when you can fetch the mark easily. Then, when
you tack, you will be able to sail full and fast enough to

82 The Yachtsman’s Guide to Racing Tactics
keep her from passing you. If you had tacked right on the
layline, she would be past it due to her relative position,
and could possibly drive over you at the mark were it nec-
essary for you to pinch near the end of the leg. The defen-
Sive tactic on the part of the leeward boat, as mentioned
before, is a sharp luff short of the layline. This will work
only if the windward boat is caught unawares. The wind-
ward boat should keep enough open water between her
and her opponent to negate the effectiveness of a luff.
Another overstanding tactic is used when a leeward boat
is being covered by a boat to windward and ahead, as in
Figure 54. The leeward skipper is banking on the hope

-- 90 of 136 --

Laylines 83
that the windward crew will be totally engrossed in cover-
ing him. As the leeward boat approaches the layline, the
skipper pinches and slows the boat. This results in the
windward boat’s sailing farther past the layline while the
leeward boat sails slowly. It further allows the leeward
boat to pinch up closer to the mark. The leeward boat
keeps on going slowly past the layline until the windward
skipper comes to his senses, realizes he has overstood, and
tacks first. Normally, he will be waiting for the leeward
boat to tack first, and will then cover. Figure 54 shows the
desired result. The leeward boat should at least maintain
an inside overlap at the mark and come out ahead.
Pete Conrad of Sobstad Sailmakers mentions a tactic that
can often be used to advantage. He was sailing in a Finn
Class National Championship and was just about laying
the weather mark on starboard tack in a breeze that was
gradually lifting him. The lead Finn was close to crossing
him, and the last thing he wanted was for the leader to tack
and to feed him bad air all the way to the mark. So Pete
shouted something to the effect of, ‘““Go ahead across, you
have it made,” whereupon his opponent took the bait,
thanked Pete, and crossed his bow. Pete slowed down inten-
tionally, and ducked the port tack boat. The competitor
sailed another ten to fifteen boat lengths, tacked, and real-
ized he had overstood the mark. Pete rounded in the lead
and won the race. Pete’s competitor had become so cap-
tivated by the boat-to-boat confrontation that he lost sight
of the overall view. As you can see with many of these
tactics, that’s the aim of the initiator. When a boat that has
right of way waves you across, immediately start wonder-
ing why. Am I sailing in a header? Is the breeze lighter
where I’m going? Is the water shallow? Could I lay the mark
on the other tack? Take the cynic’s viewpoint that altruism
is hard to find on the race course.
Dick Tillman used a tactic in the Snipe Nationals that
is effective when worked with precision. He was short of
the layline on starboard tack, close to the weather quarter
of his major competitor. His plan was to pin the leeward
boat to keep her from tacking until he could lay the mark.
_ He initiated his tack for the mark at a point where his

-- 91 of 136 --

84 The Yachtsman’s Guide to Racing Tactics
crew had to back the jib to swing the bow over fast enough
to avoid hitting the buoy. This necessitated the leeward
boat’s sailing past the mark before tacking and returning
on port tack. In the meantime, Dick had rounded to port,
and had established a starboard tack on the next reaching
leg, just as his competitor was returning to the mark on
port tack. Not caring to add injury to insult, Dick elected
to take his transom and not to protest. After all, Dick had
placed him in that situation in the first place.
Isaw another interesting weather mark tactic in the Pan
American Games. Peter Barrett was sailing a Finn, and
had only one competitor giving him trouble. Peter was on
starboard tack, just barely laying the mark, with his com-
petition about half a boat length dead to leeward. There
were no windows in the sails, so Peter couldn’t see the
other boat. His competition banked on this blind spot, and
sailed right past the mark. He expected Peter to bear off to
a reach around the mark and to foul him since Peter, as
windward boat, had to stay clear of a leeward boat. How-
ever, no such thing happened. Peter kept on going close-
hauled until his competitor realized after fifty yards or so
that there was no future in continuing. Peter obviously
wasn’t taking the bait, and the leeward boat still had to
jibe, sail all the way back, and round the mark. Peter won
the race easily. I asked Peter later how he had figured out
what his competition intended to do. Half, he said, was
knowing his competition. The other half was sensing
something amiss when he had reached the mark, and
could still see nothing of the other boat.
I sometimes approach a layline on port tack, deliber-
ately using another port tack boat to leeward and ahead as
a spoiler. If a starboard tacker comes along that could give
me trouble, the other port tack has to tack first, which can
slow the starboard tack boat down and allow me to cross
them both. It is sometimes the edge needed to reach the
layline, tack on both of them, and round the mark ahead.

7. Weather Mark
Roundings
The greatest area of congestion in a race is at the start,
but the next greatest is at the first weather mark rounding.
The boats that can spurt out of that mess in good order
stand a good chance to lengthen their lead on the bulk of
the fleet. When the second leg is a spinnaker reach and
there’s a bunch of boats clustered close behind you, con-
sider delaying the spinnaker set and reaching high to
avoid having them on your wind. When they fall down to
course and set spinnakers, do the same. When there’s a
large space of open water between you and the boats be-
hind you, the opposite tactic is usually the best: turn right
down to course, and set the spinnaker quickly to lengthen
the distance between you and your pursuers. They will
probably luff each other up high of the course, and, along
with having to sail a longer distance, they will have to sail
on a slower point of sail to get down to the mark.

-- 93 of 136 --

86 The Yachtsman’s Guide to Racing Tactics
Years ago Bill Cox (American Eagle’s helmsman in the
1968 America’s Cup Trials) told me a tactic he used which
is now fairly common: the delayed spinnaker set. When
rounding a weather mark in close proximity behind an-
other boat, sail across the wind on a close reach for a few
moments with main and jib trimmed properly. Assuming
the boat ahead falls right down to course, her speed will
be markedly slowed by the crew’s bouncing around and
the windage of the spinnaker’s going up. Meanwhile the
weather boat gets on her wind, which makes leeward’s
spinnaker more difficult to fly. Once in such a controlling
position, the windward boat sets her chute. That the
process also slows her down doesn’t affect their relative
positions, since the leeward boat is being blanketed. The
obvious defense is for the lead boat to sail on a close reach
to discourage such a maneuver.
Hans Fogh once played the “delayed spinnaker set” in
reverse. In a 1965 Flying Dutchman race in Italy, a Swiss
boat was leading, and Hans was in second place with the
rest of the fleet way behind. The two remaining legs on the
race were close reaches, and to pass the lead boat would
be close to impossible. He figured that if he set a spin-
naker, so would the Swiss. If he luffed to pass to windward,
so would the Swiss... a virtual standoff. So, rounding the
last weather mark to begin the last two reaches, Hans’s
crew made all kinds of commotion, yelling and screaming
as they set the spinnaker. As soon as the Swiss saw the
spinnaker going up behind, he immediately turned his
back and began setting his. Whereupon, Hans pulled his
down, and, when the Swiss’s spinnaker was full, he sailed
right around him to weather (since the reach was so close)
and went on to win the race.
Most race committees attempt to make a 45-90-45 de-
gree right triangle for a course. If the windward leg is
perfect, meaning the wind is blowing directly to the start-
ing line from the windward mark, then the apparent wind
on the first reach will be slightly forward of abeam, and it
will be the same for the second reach. Seasoned racing
sailors become accustomed to the reaching wind angle,

-- 94 of 136 --

Weather Mark Roundings 87
and often even the best get disoriented after a wind shift.
If the wind veers clockwise and they reach off with the
apparent wind slightly forward of abeam, they will be
well high of the reaching mark. I’ve heard that even Paul
Elvstrom sailed to the wrong reaching mark in one pre-
Olympics. Inevitably, the fleet follows, since the best sail-
ors are usually in front, and most of the others think the
leaders must be right. It’s interesting to look at what tal-
ented sailors do when they realize they’ve made a mistake
or discover the mark isn’t where it ought to be.
Peter Bordes was leading a Thistle race on a low visi-
bility day, and suddenly realized that the mark was al-
most dead to leeward. He had been close-reaching much
too high, and the fleet was following. If he headed dead
downwind on a run toward the mark, the rest of the fleet
would spot it, and cut the corner on him. They would still
be reaching at a fast clip while he would be running. He
had a great idea. He told his crew to throw off the main
halyard, as if it had broken. As the mainsail came tum-
bling down, he stood up in the boat swearing at his bad
luck. The fleet sailed by enjoying the scene. As the last
boat passed, his crew raised the mainsail, set the spin-
naker, headed for the mark, rounded first, and won the
race.
Jim Mattingly had a similar problem in the 1971 Half
Ton Cup World’s Championships. He was leading the fleet
on a reach, realized the mark was to leeward, but noticed
a fog bank to windward. He pretended to see the mark to
weather, and hardened up under the spinnaker. The fleet
followed him into the fog bank. As soon as Jim’s boat was
well hidden from the rest, he jibed and finished the race
hours ahead of the other boats.
Hans Fogh found himself in a somewhat similar situa-
tion on a weather leg. He was directly to leeward of a
bunch of boats, and no one could find the mark. Hans knew
that the mark was still to weather, but he took advantage
of the uncertainty of the others to pull off a little ruse. He
spotted a mark (of a like type to the true weather mark)
directly in front of him. He rounded it, and, much to his
pleasure, all the boats to windward bore off to round the

-- 95 of 136 --

88 The Yachtsman’s Guide to Racing Tactics
same mark. He slowed the boat down, and waited for them
all to round. Then he immediately tacked, beat up to the
real weather mark, and ended up winning the race.
The common denominator in all these cases is a fertile
imagination and an indomitable spirit that snatches vic-
tory from the jaws of defeat.

-- 96 of 136 --

8. Reaches
Perhaps less dramatic, but nevertheless helpful to a
winning effort, are some of the other tactics used on
reaches. Since an inside overlap at the jibing mark can
mean a difference of many places, one sails the leg with
that in mind. If a boat luffs up to pass you to windward, you
must protect your position by luffing also. On a tight spin-
naker reach leg of an Olympic course race, we were just
ahead of Running Tide. The air was light, and, though
Running Tide was a larger boat than Sleuth, we had
beaten her to the windward mark. Early in the reaching
leg, we luffed her very high of the course to the jibing
mark when she attempted to pass us to windward. This
discouraged her from trying again, so she tried sailing
through our lee, which didn’t work. Later in the leg, near-
ing the jibing mark, she tried to break through to wind-
ward again. This time I luffed far less. Ideally, I wanted

-- 97 of 136 --

90 The Yachtsman’s Guide to Racing Tactics
them to be overlapped to the outside of us, so I could head
at the mark with an inside overlap. When it became obvi-
ous that she was going to power over us, I let her go. Run-
ning Tide passed us, and, when she was clear ahead, we
held a course that would take us past the buoy outside the
two-boat-lengths circle. If we had headed for the mark
when we were within two boat lengths, we would not have
been overlapped and would not have been entitled to
room. We would have just followed her around the mark.
The crew on Running Tide obviously wanted to jibe for
the mark, but couldn’t without fouling us in the process.
When we reached the spot shown in Figure 55, well past
the mark, we jibed, and had an inside overlap at the mark

with Running Tide tucked away in our bad air. What this
incident shows is the type of thought processes that must
go on in racing. Many skippers luff any boat passing to
windward indiscriminately, without thought about the
desired end result. Again, put your head a hundred yards
in front of your boat.
Whether to sail high or low of course on a reach depends
a great deal on the anticipated wind strength and direc-
tion. When the breeze is fresh early in the leg and you
expect it to soften, sail low initially. This allows you to
harden up to a faster point of sailing as the wind dies. The
opposite course is taken when you expect a light breeze to
freshen. Head high first, and come off as the breeze
strengthens. With a wind that is steady in direction, but
changeable in strength, fall off for speed in the puffs, and
head up in the lulls. This will also keep you in the puffs
longer as they move downwind.
Current is also a factor on reaches. Generally, in a con-
trary or cross-current situation, the best course is the
shortest distance, and, thus, the shortest time in the effect
of the current. You often know roughly the strength and
direction of the current from current tables studied before
the race. Just how much it is affecting you can be seen
after you’ve sailed down the leg for a while. Steer your boat
directly at the jibing mark ahead and glance astern. With
no current the weather mark should be dead astern. If it’s
more to the starboard side of the boat, you’ve been set to
the left of the course and vice versa. When the jibing mark
can be easily distinguished against a shore line, try to steer
your boat so the shore doesn’t move behind the buoy. If the
buoy moves to the right along the shore, you are being set
to the left of course by the current, and must steer more to
starboard to offset it.

-- 99 of 136 --

9. Jibe Mark
We are finishing the first reaching leg, and approaching
the jibing mark. When the first reach is broad, the next
reach will be quite tight, and an early jibe is dictated. If
possible, complete the jibe before arriving at the mark so
you are free to harden up to the new course right at the
mark. In this way you will lose nothing to leeward. The
opposite is true if the first reach is tight, but it doesn’t take
much to realize you shouldn’t start the jibe early. With a
tight reach it’s natural to start jibing after arriving at the
mark. :
Though it’s beneficial to be the inside boat at the mark,
there are many times when it just isn’t possible to get the
required overlap before reaching the two-boat-length cir-
cle. When a large number of boats are overlapped, the
outside boats squeeze the inside boats fairly close to the
mark. This prevents the inside boats from playing it wide
at the approach and tight at the turn. When you know you

-- 100 of 136 --

Jibe Mark 93
don’t have a chance for an overlap, a good tactic is to slow
the boat down by collapsing your spinnaker or luffing your
mainsail. Then, swing out wide, and do an early jibe.
Harden up for the mark past the sterns of the overlapped
boats, and go for the opening between the mark and the
stern of the inside boat. It’s risky and takes excellent tim-
ing, but it can be done.
If you round in front of a number of boats, luff sharply
after the mark to discourage any of them from attempting
to pass you to windward. It doesn’t hurt to end up a little
high of course on the second reaching leg of a marks-to-
port triangle, because that will put you inside at the lee-
ward mark. So while we luff with discretion on the first
reach, we luff with vengeance on the second to keep from
being passed.
Knowing that such will be the tendency of an opponent
ahead of you, any luff on your part to get to weather of
him should be done very early and sharply. Don’t climb
up his stern and then decide to pass, because you'll be
luffed right off the course. When you are still a few boat
lengths back, go up sharply. If you’re lucky, the skipper
of. the boat ahead won’t notice your move until it’s too
late. When there are one or two boat lengths of open
water to close before the leeward boat can effectively luff
a windward boat, leeward may not even try. By the time
he gets up to you, you may very well have a mast abeam
position, and the leeward boat would be unable to luff
legally. By closing the gap in attempting to luff, the lee-
ward boat is now sailing slower, in a more disturbed area
of your wind shadow.

abeam. Leeward can no longer luff, and must fall back to
her proper course.
There are times when the tactical interplay between
boats on reaches is done at long distance. Chris Bouzaid,
President of Hood Sailmakers (U.S.A.) Inc., recounts what
he calls his favorite ocean racing maneuver. He has used
this tactic on two One Ton Cup Championships, and it is
very effective. Two boats are on a tight spinnaker reach.
The lead boat is eight to ten minutes ahead, and the objec-
tive in Chris’s trailing boat is to close the distance. Chris
first establishes very clearly where the turning mark is. At
this point the mark is not within sight. Because both boats
have been reaching for some time, they have sagged below
course, and eventually will have to douse their spinnakers
to reach up to the mark under jibs.
With about ten miles to go, Chris starts sailing the boat
as high as he can to windward, losing speed while doing
so. Although Chris may be gaining a little weather ground,
the lead boat is assuredly opening the gap between them.
This situation continues for the next five miles, by which
time Chris has made a considerable distance to windward,
but is far behind. The turning mark is spotted, and it
becomes obvious that both spinnakers will have to be
doused for the boats to fetch the mark. At this stage, the
combination of being way behind and well to weather cre-
ates an easy reach to the mark for Chris. The lead boat,
being so far ahead and downwind of the mark, has to go
closehauled to fetch it, and often has to tack. The distance
between the mark and the two boats is almost the same, so
Chris has closed the distance between the two boats con-
siderably with this maneuver.

-- 103 of 136 --

10. Leeward Mark
As the leeward mark is approached on the second reach,
it’s again desirable to get an inside overlap. In Figure 57,
boat A is trying to get to weather of boat B for an inside
overlap at the mark. Boat B luffs sharply, and, as the two-
boat-length circle is approached, boat B falls off toward
the mark. Often this turn can break the overlap and place
the windward yacht in a “clear astern” position, defined in
the rules as “when her hull and equipment in normal
position are abaft an imaginary line projected abeam
from the aftermost point of the other’s hull and equipment
in normal position.” As the leeward boat turns toward the
mark, this imaginary line swings forward, and the overlap
is broken.
There is another option that is often used when you don’t
care about the rest of the fleet, and there is only one oppo-
nent you must beat. The leeward boat may carry the over-
lapped windward boat to the wrong side of the turning

*. no overlap

mark, but there are a number of provisions in the rules
that must be met: (1) the leeward boat must have luffing
rights; (2) before she is within two of her overall lengths
of the mark, she must hail the windward boat that she
plans to take her to windward of the mark; (3) she must
begin to luff before she is within two of her overall lengths
of the mark; and (4) she must also pass to windward of the
mark. This last requirement has been interpreted to mean
she must cross an imaginary line perpendicular to the
mark and the course from the last mark, before turning
back to reround properly. Because there are so many res-
trictions on this tactic that must be fulfilled exactly by the
leeward boat, it isn’t often used. However, I’ve done it suc-
cessfully downwind at a finish line against a windward
boat that would have just barely beaten me had I con-
tinued straight across.
A good tactic at the leeward mark when the spinnaker
is to be doused is to leave it up until the last possible mo-
ment and to sail to leeward of a bunch of boats. In a race
aboard Sleuth, we were vying with Intuition for the lead
when we both fell into a hole. The rest of the fleet sailed

-- 105 of 136 --

98 The Yachtsman’s Guide to Racing Tactics
right up with a light breeze, and their momentum took
them right through us to the mark. The tables had turned
on us completely, and we were almost last. The mass of
boats stalled at the mark when they doused their spinnak-
ers. I saw a stronger breeze filling in from windward. A
couple of the leaders had broken free from the group, and
they were moving out closehauled in the freshening wind.
I elected to stay well low of the jumble of boats, and, with
the pole on the headstay, to sail with the spinnaker on as
tight a reach as possible. We broke through the lee of the
largest bunch, doused the spinnaker well past the mark,
and hardened up. We then tacked on to starboard, which
took us directly toward the new wind. Most of the group of
boats that were stalled at the mark took our stern on port
tack, and we were back in decent position, having gained
back about ten to twelve boats.
When there is a strong current against you in light air,
consider a late spinnaker douse. The boats ahead that
have doused too early now find themselves with too little
sail area to stem the current, and the rest of the fleet is
catching up under spinnaker and blanketing the boats
ahead. To avoid this situation, assuming that you are ei-
ther leading or have a clear shot at the mark, carry your
spinnaker right up to or even past the mark if the current
could set you onto the mark as you round. When you reach
a position where the current will just about set you to the
proper side of the mark if you lost your way, douse the
spinnaker. For the small amount of delay going to wind-
ward, you are at least sure of having cleared the mark.
Normally, if current and other boats are not a worry, the
proper mark rounding is to swing wide in the beginning,
and thus be close to the mark at the point where you are
closehauled. Boat A in Figure 58 has made a smooth, even
rounding, and is on the wind right next to the mark. Boat
B has approached too close to the mark, drifts out on the
turn, and ends up on the wind well to leeward of boat A.
Since it is doubtful she could tack without fouling boat A,
boat B has gone from a winning position to a losing one.
Naturally, boat B could make a much tighter turn if her
spinnaker were down, and she were prepared for it. How-

-- 106 of 136 --

wind
Figure 58
ever, since a tight turn results in a large loss of speed, the
result would be the same.
If you do a decent rounding, as does boat A in Figure 58,
but it’s right behind a number of other boats, a common
maneuver is to shoot almost head to wind to gain some
breathing space. Quite often the crew of a boat ahead
hasn’t finished cleaning up after the spinnaker leg, the
boat is heeling too much because the crew isn’t hiking, or
the skipper may not be on the wind because of other dis-
tractions. As long as you aren’t heading dead at the stern
of the boat ahead, you have a good chance of passing. The
luff barely slows you down if it’s part of a continuing turn
around the mark as the centrifugal force of the mast and
sails shoots the boat to windward. With just a half boat
length of open water to windward of the boat ahead, con-
centration on accurate steering and crewing can ensure
SUCCESS.
A luff sometimes doesn’t work if the boat ahead has also
luffed to avoid the backwind of another in front of her. A
tack away from the bad air is often the answer, but will not
be successful if the boat ahead also tacks and covers you.
This is the time to watch carefully for an opportunity. On
some larger day-racing keelboats, a crew member has to
get on deck to clear the spinnaker pole. Sometimes the

-- 107 of 136 --

100 The Yachtsman’s Guide to Racing Tactics
crew forgets to get the outhaul on the mainsail out. Wait
until the skipper or crew of the boat ahead is distracted by
some problem that will delay them from tacking immedi-
ately to cover you; then tack. This is an excellent way of
breaking cover.
AFTER ROUNDING THE LEEWARD MARK
When you are in the enviable position of having a com-
manding lead on the fleet, and neither side of the course
is advantageous, standard practice dictates the use of a
tactic called “splitting the distance.” After rounding the
mark and hardening up to closehauled, check how far
back your nearest competition is. When they have covered
half the distance to the mark, tack. By the time they reach
the mark, you should be dead upwind of them. This places
you squarely between your destination and your competi-
tion. To beat you they have to go “through” you, which is
very difficult.
Some of the greatest gains and losses occur shortly after
rounding the leeward mark. It is essential to know
whether you are sailing in a header or a lift, and to judge
which way you expect the wind to shift. A shift may have
occurred on the second reaching leg, where it’s more diffi-
cult to detect. The apparent wind would go forward, but
this also happens if the breeze lightens, so the skipper may
not have noticed. After rounding and sailing closehauled
for a while, as in Figure 59, he suddenly notices that other
boats, which have rounded long after, are well up inside
of him. While he was sailing on a header, the other boats
were on the reaching leg. When they reached the mark,
the wind backed, lifting all boats on port tack. This put the
boats at the mark in an instantly favorable position vis-a-
vis the skipper who sailed in a header. If he recognizes this
fact, he may keep on sailing on the lift, and wait for the
next header to come before tacking. If he doesn’t realize
what has happened, he may feel his bad position was
caused by poor crew work or perhaps more wind where
the other boats are. This might prompt him to tack, where-

-- 108 of 136 --

wind
Figure 59
upon he would be sailing in a header when all the others
are sailing in a lift—a bad move.
The solution is to avoid getting into the position before
it happens. If you haven’t been able to determine any wind
shift on the reaching leg, check your compass course after
rounding and sailing closehauled. You should know your
heading on port tack from the last beat, and compare it
with your present heading. If lifted, hold on; if headed,
tack. Remember, however, that the other tack will take
you toward the other boats that haven’t rounded yet. Their
sails can chop up the wind quite badly, and, though you
have right of way (being leeward boat on starboard tack),
the amount gained from the shift is offset somewhat by the
amount lost to bad air.

leg, and we realized the wind had shifted aft (a port tack
lift). We were behind and outside a number of boats at the
turn, and normally would have tacked away to clear our
air. Instead, we reached off to leeward, and broke through
the lee of the boats to windward. When the header re-
turned we got it first, tacked, and crossed a number of the
boats that had beaten us to the mark.

11. The Beat to a
Run and the Run
The second beat isn’t much different from the first, ex-
cept that the competition is more spread out, and one
starts thinking about staying between the competition and
the mark, covering, and avoiding taking flyers. Often the
wind has shifted more to one side of the course, making
one tack the long tack to the mark. Generally, the proper
tactic is to take the long tack first. This is in keeping with
the premise of avoiding the laylines, as the short tack will
take you to the laylines faster.
As you can see in Figure 60 on page 104, a boat that sails
tack from the leeward mark in the new veered wind (in-
dicated by dashes) will soon reach the starboard tack lay-
line, and will overstand if she continues on. Since she will
be spending so little time on port tack and so much more
time on starboard, she must play the windshifts differ-
ently from the first weather leg. The skipper will generally
tack on a small header when on port tack, but will absorb

a much greater header on starboard, since he must remain
on starboard tack for such a greater distance.
The approach to the weather mark for rounding to a run
demands different considerations from those of rounding
to a reach. It usually does not pay to hold high after round-
ing, except to clear your air, because you lose so much
distance by not heading directly downwind at the mark.
This is particularly so when the course to the leeward
mark necessitates a jibe. If we’re leaving marks to port and
the wind has shifted, as shown in Figure 60, the long tack
upwind will be starboard, and the run will be on port. Just
remember “starboard tack up, port back” and vice versa.
As you approach the weather mark, a decision must be
made as to which tack to run on. If the wind is fairly
parallel to the course and the next leg is almost directly
downwind, the starboard tack makes the most sense for
port roundings. Since you are approaching on starboard,
it’s easiest to set up the spinnaker pole for that tack. A jibe
set is usually slower, and on larger yachts there’s more
that can go wrong (e.g., the spinnaker’s wrapping around
the jib during the jibe). :
Another disadvantage to having the pole and spinnaker

-- 112 of 136 --

The Beat toa Run and the Run 105
all set up for a jibe to port occurs when you have ended up
outside of other boats at the mark. I have seen boats in this
position, held off by inside leeward boats, unable to jibe to
port because the leeward boats were on starboard tack.
The outside boat has to wait until the others have cleared
out ahead before she is able to jibe past their sterns to set
her own spinnaker.
A boat that takes the port tack after rounding sails into
the congestion of sailboats approaching the weather
mark, whereas starboard tack takes the boat away. The
congestion can cause two problems: (1) all the closehauled
boats, whether on port or starboard tacks, have right of
way over the boat running free on port tack; and (2) all the
closehauled boats on the starboard tack layline, to wind-
ward of the running boat, disturb the wind terribly. In
light air the running boat’s spinnaker can be well blan-
keted by these closehauled boats.
Once around the mark, it’s crucial to keep away from the
blanket zone of another boat. In light winds the zone of
disturbed air carries for quite a number of boat lengths
downwind from the windward boat. The helmsman of the
windward boat will try to stay “on the wind” of the lee-
ward boat by keeping his masthead fly pointed right at the
leeward boat. At times it may be necessary to reach up a
little for extra speed to get the leeward boat in your blan-
ket zone. Doing so makes the distance between the boats
greater and your blanket less effective. But some blanket-
ing is better than none, and you should still be able to slow
the leeward boat enough to start gaining back the lost
distance.
It’s often best to stay out of luffing matches on the lee-
ward leg. When you and another boat are in a luffing
match on a reach, the luff is still somewhat in the direc-
tion the fleet is sailing. A luff on a run may take you at
right angles to the course. While the fleet is sailing toward
the mark, you are making zero progress toward it. Further-
more, when you curtail the luff and fall back down to
course, you will have to sail lower than the rest of the fleet,
which will have a better point of sailing on you.

-- 113 of 136 --

Figure 61
On a run, you use the benefits of blanketing mainly to
close the distance and to catch the lead boats, but it usually
takes a jibe or two to get through safely. In Figure 61 the
trailing boat has gradually cut down the lead of the lead-
ing boat by disturbing her wind. At position A the lead boat
luffs up to protect herself, whereupon the trailing boat
jibes and the lead boat follows suit a few moments later.
At position B the trailing boat is still on the lead boat’s
wind, and has an inside overlap at the mark. The mistake
the lead boat made was in not anticipating the jibe of the
trailing boat. By either jibing first or being prepared to jibe
at the same instant, the lead boat would be to leeward with
luffing rights, and could protect her position by luffing.

-- 114 of 136 --

The Beat toa Run and the Run 107
Luffing can only be done by a leeward boat to prevent a
windward boat from passing. When a boat catches up
from behind to leeward, the reason she cannot luff during
the existence of the overlap is that the helmsman of the
windward boat was forward of the mainmast of the lee-
ward boat when the overlap was established. The overlap
begins when the boats, one of which is no longer clear
astern, are within two overall lengths of the longer one. If,
as they converge, and an overlap is established, the mast
of the leeward boat is forward of windward’s helmsman,
the right to luff is also established.
Another way luffing rights can be established by a boat
that is catching up to leeward is by a couple of jibes. A new
overlap begins after a jibe has been completed. In Figure
62, position B, a boat has caught up from behind, and has
=	SK	wind

-- 115 of 136 --

108 The Yachtsman’s Guide to Racing Tactics
established an overlap to leeward. Because her mast is
behind windward’s helmsman, she cannot luff while that
overlap exists. At position B, she jibes to starboard tack
and back to port at position C. A new overlap is established
at that point. The leeward boat now has luffing rights, for
her mast was forward of windward’s helmsman when the
new overlap was created.
Bob Johnstone, who builds and successfully races the
J-24, J-30 and J-36 class sailboats designed by his brother,
Rod, uses a subtle tactic to shorten the lead of a boat in
front of him on a run. He teases the skipper ahead into
sailing a longer course to the leeward mark. When his
competitor looks back to check on Bob’s position, Bob
steers a little high. The competition steers higher yet. Bob
immediately resumes his previous course to the mark, but
his competitor, having gone higher, takes longer to get
back down to course. Then Bob will exaggerate going low
for a moment while the competitor sails low for fifteen to
thirty seconds. Bob claims this tactic, done repeatedly, is
usually good for three or four boat lengths, or even more,
if you can blanket the boat ahead.
WIND SHIFTS
One of the most important tactical decisions on a run is
how to play the wind. On a beat we almost always tack in
heading wind shifts. Well, on a run it’s the opposite. We
jibe in lifts. Whereas failure to play the wind shifts prop-
erly on a beat can result in startling losses, the results are
not as dramatic on runs. You will still be heading roughly
toward the leeward mark. In Figure 63 boats A and B are
sailing dead downwind toward the leeward mark on star-
board tack. A new wind that is a lift comes in. It allows
boat A to head up, which she does. Now boat A is no longer
heading directly at the mark. She is sailing a longer dis-
tance on a dead downwind run. Boat B has jibed to port,
and is heading at the mark on a much faster point of
sailing. ;
Let’s say the course to the leeward mark is 195°, and we
know that the true wind was 200° when we rounded the

original
wind
Figure 63
weather mark (see Figure 64 on page 110). We are sailing
on port tack 20° high of the true wind in light air to gain
more boat speed from a higher velocity apparent wind. We
watch our compass, and keep the apparent wind angle
constant by observing the angle of the masthead fly or our
apparent-wind-direction instrument. Since we head off in
gusts and up in lulls, we have to be careful not to make
decisions based on the different apparent wind velocity.
Our compass shows we have been lifted to 170° with the
apparent wind direction and velocity unchanged. This in-
dicates that 190° is dead downwind, and, since we desire a
course of 195°, the starboard tack is closer and, therefore,
faster.
If the wind shift is continual, you again play it the oppo-
site of a beat. On a beat you sail toward expected headers.
On a run you sail away from them. In Figure 65 on page
110, boats A and B are sailing at equal speed toward the
leeward mark. Boat A has sailed toward the new wind
direction, and when it arrives, she has to sail dead down-
wind to the leeward mark. Boat B has sailed away from the

new wind direction. She jibes and is on more of a reach,
a much faster point of sail, when the new wind arrives.
This tactic is fine if the wind shifts only a few degrees.
However, if the wind continues to veer so much that boat
A is beam-reaching on port tack, and boat B can’t carry a
spinnaker to get to the mark, the benefits of sailing away
from the shift are lost.
As you approach the leeward mark on a run, it’s very
important to get to the inside of the fleet. It may be that the
right side of the leg was the place to be for wind, but that
won’t be much help if you find yourself outside a stack of
ten boats at the mark. Consider the problem early to avoid
getting caught in the wrong spot. Even if you have to
harden up very sharply and cross a few sterns, it can be of

benefit an Figure 66 boat A has crossed B’s stern, jibes, and
returns on starboard tack with an overlap at the mark.
Boat B’s defense is shown in ,Figure 67, where she also
heads high of the mark. By jibing she breaks the overlap
as the boats turn down to the two-boat-lengths circle.
It’s good fun and a source of satisfaction to keep another
boat from getting an inside overlap at the leeward mark.
During Antigua Race Week on a leeward leg, we, on
Sleuth, were trying to foil Desperado (later lost at sea at-

-- 120 of 136 --

The Beat toa Run and the Run 113
tempting to better the transatlantic elapsed time record)
from obtaining an inside overlap at the mark. We were
running dead downwind on starboard tack, the course to
the mark being almost by-the-lee. Desperado was astern
and to windward. As she approached on our windward
(starboard) side, we held up high, and the skipper soon
realized he wouldn’t get through us to weather. This also
made the proper course to the mark farther by-the-lee.
Desperado then attempted to obtain an overlap to leeward,
and we immediately fell off for the mark. To avoid jibing,
and thereby fouling Desperado by jibing too close to her,
we held our boom out over the side of the boat. Desperado’s
crew did the same, which played beautifully into our
hands. Desperado was a three-quarters rig with a tremen-
dous mainsail, while Sleuth is a masthead rig with a high-
aspect-ratio mainsail. Holding the respective mainsails
out against the wind slowed Desperado far more than
Sleuth. Even though Desperado was a much faster down-
wind boat, we successfully held her off at the mark.
Maintaining starboard tack by holding the boom over
the port side of the boat is a standard tactic. The “Defini-
tions” in the racing rules state: “A yacht is on the tack
(starboard or port) corresponding to her windward side.
The leeward side of a yacht is that on which she is...
carrying her mainsail. The opposite side is the windward
side.” It doesn’t matter that the wind is coming over the
“leeward” side of the boat as long as the mainsail is out
over that side. Be aware that a jibe isn’t completed until
the mainsail fills normally on the other tack. If it isn’t
completed, you are still in the process of jibing, and you
have no legal rights over a boat that is on a tack.

12. Anchoring
There are times when the breeze is so light that the
current overpowers it. Rather than lose precious distance
to the mark, anchor your boat. If you are the first to anchor,
you will stay in one place while the rest of the fleet is
moving backward. I’ve anchored at night and seen us
“passing” running light after running light, just as if we
had double the boat speed of the others. To press the ad-
vantage of being the first to anchor, no one else should
realize you’ve done it. Quietly slip the anchor over the
leeward side near the shrouds, One crew member should
do it while the rest pretend to be racing the boat for all
they’re worth. An anchorline running along the hull is
hard to see, so it’s possible no one will notice that you’re
anchored. Arthur Knapp says this tactic was pulled on
him by Cornelius Shields way back in 1933. It’s been used
a lot since then.

-- 122 of 136 --

Anchoring 115
An anchor can be used for purposes other than actual
anchoring. I was sailing as tactician on Carina during an
Admiral’s Cup Cowes Week race in England. The start was
in total drifting conditions with a three-knot current car-
rying the fleet across the starting line. Dick Nye, the
owner, asked for my suggestions about starting under such
conditions. There was only one way, in my mind: power to
a location where, when the five-minute gun sounded and
the engine had to be turned off, we would have five min-
utes of drifting with the current to the line. We judged the
distance quite accurately, but failed to get turned around.
We were drifting stern first toward the starting line. All of
the Class 1 fleet was also drifting in a mass to the line,
bouncing against one another and fending off. There was
only one boat heading in the proper direction that had
been able to pick up the slightest zephyr. We had to get the
boat turned around. I called for the anchor to be lowered
over the stern just far enough to drag along the bottom, but
not to hold. Immediately our bow swung down-current. We
lifted the anchor, and were second out of the mess.

-- 123 of 136 --

13. Finishing
The tactic that consistently accounts for the most places
won or lost at an upwind finish is sailing to the downwind
end of the line. Just as the upwind end of the line is fa-
vored at the start, the downwind end is favored at the
finish.
In the 1968 Olympics, I saw Buddy Friedrichs, the U.S.
skipper in the Dragon class, take four sterns and still
finish first. Buddy was on port tack laying the starboard
end of a long finish line. He met four other Dragons on
starboard tack, one after another, and ducked under the
stern of each. Rather than tacking on him, they all con-
tinued toward the port (buoy)-end of the line. By choosing
the downwind end, Buddy went from fifth to first in a
couple of hundred yards and won the gold medal.
Unfortunately, it’s very difficult to determine which end
is downwind. You don’t have the same opportunity as at
the start to take the bearing of the line, and to compare it
with the wind direction. However, there are a few tactics
that can help.

-- 124 of 136 --

Finishing 117
As you approach the finish, you have four laylines to
deal with: port and starboard tack laylines to the port end
and both laylines to the starboard end. The four laylines
are shown with the wind square to the line (see Figure 68).
You never want to sail past the first layline you reach. A
starboard tack boat will tack on the port tack layline to the
starboard end. A port tack boat will tack on the starboard
tack layline to the port end, as shown in Figure 68.
In Figure 69 on page 118, the wind has veered making
the port end downwind by a good margin. As two boats
approach the intersection of the two laylines, it is obvious
that boat B will have a much shorter distance to sail than
boat A. The buoy will seem closer than the committee boat.
Distances are deceiving when you are comparing two
objects of such disparate size as a buoy and a yacht. Fur-
ther, it is rare that you will ever find yourself precisely at
wind

wind

Figure 69
the intersection of both laylines. You are sailing tactically
among other boats that you may haveto cover or to break
away from. This determines your approach to the line,
which may be quite different from the course you would
have taken in the absence of other boats. Try to judge
whether you are sailing more parallel to the line or more
across it. It sounds like a simple-minded tactic—sail across
the line, not parallel to it—but it’s amazing how many
skippers take the course of boat A in Figure 69 until they
reach the middle of the line and then tack. They should
tack immediately when they can lay the buoy on starboard
tack.
Harry Sindle, many-time national champion in a num-
ber of classes, considers the finish at the completion of the
second weather leg of an Olympic course. Often the com-
mittee boat has moved from the leeward mark where the
race was started, and has set a finish line at the weather
mark. As he tacks to go around the weather mark for the
run, he is crossing what will be the finish line two legs
hence. When head to wind during that tack, he observes
whether either end is abaft abeam. That end will be the
downwind end at the finish, barring any major wind shifts.
If you know the ability of the race committee, you may

-- 126 of 136 --

Finishing 119
be able to tell which end is favored simply by the wind
direction. If the wind is essentially straight down the
course line from the windward mark to the leeward mark,
the finish line will be set perpendicular to the course, and
neither end will be favored. If the wind has veered, and
the finish line is still perpendicular to the course line, then
the port end will be downwind as in Figure 69.
Race committees are now expected to adjust slightly for
the wind direction by splitting the difference between the
finish line’s being square to the wind and being square to
the course from the last mark. In the past the line was
always supposed to be square to the course regardless of
wind direction. Though this change cuts down the amount
one end of the finish line can be favored over the other, it
doesn’t alter the fact that if the wind shifts to the right of
the course, the port end should be downwind and vice
versa. As you sail up the last weather leg, therefore, keep
in mind the true wind direction. If the port tack takes you
closer to the finish (the long tack), then the wind has
backed, and the starboard end is downwind.
Finishing tactics involving other boats are used either to
pin them away from the line or to force them onto the
unfavored tack more parallel to the line. Figure 70 on page
120 shows the finish line approach of Whirlwind and
Sleuth in one race. As Whirlwind came at us on port, we
normally would have tacked ahead of her and a little to
windward. However, this would have allowed her the pos-
sibility of pinching up above us and curtailing our ability
to tack across the line, since we would be tacking too close.
She would then tack when she could clear the buoy, and
possibly nip us at the finish because the buoy end was so
heavily favored. The timing of the tack was crucial.
Sleuth is a large, heavy boat and doesn’t pick up speed
very fast after a tack in a seaway. Sleuth’s tacking too early
would allow Whirlwind to stick her bow to weather be-
tween us and the mark as we gathered momentum. Our
tacking too late would allow her to drive through our lee
and luff us as we struggled to get speed up. Her speed, if she
shot into the wind for the line, would probably have carried
her across ahead of Sleuth. My tack had to be completed

-- 127 of 136 --

Whirlwind
Figure 70
before her mast came abeam of me, the windward helms-
man. In this way she’d have no luffing rights, and yet be
pinned to leeward of me. Fortunately, the maneuver
worked perfectly. It’s a fairly standard tactic, but a difficult
one to perform on ocean-racing yachts so close to the finish.
Head reaching, shooting into the wind across the line, is
a useful tactic in trying to nip ahead of a close competitor.
It works only in boats that carry a great deal of momen-
tum, such as large displacement keelboats. It also works
best on light days rather than heavy. When the wind and
seas are high, the boat is stopped quickly by the windage
of the rigging and the force of the seas against the hull.
When you’re about one boat length from the line, shoot
dead into the wind as boat B does in Figure 71. Boats A and

-- 128 of 136 --

Finishing 121
B are equidistant upwind, and would cross the line at the
same instant if both sailed straight. By shooting the line,
boat B slows down, but sails such a short distance com-
pared to boat A that she wins. The timing has to be perfect:
shoot too late and its value has been lost; shoot too early
and you may lose all momentum before reaching the line.
Of the two errors, the latter is more prevalent. Just as
skippers think they are right on the starting line well be-
fore they reach it, so do finishers seem to believe they have
crossed the line well before they actually have. Sail a little
farther than your instincts tell you before shooting.
The racing rule “Definitions” state that “A yacht is rac-
ing... until she has... finished and cleared the finishing
line and finishing marks. .. .” Clearing the finishing line
means the boat is no longer touching any part of it. Since
you finish when any part of the hull, crew or equipment
in normal position crosses the finishing line from the di-
rection of the course from the last mark, your boat doesn’t
have to cross the line entirely to be legally finished. You
can drop back on the course side of the line and sail home.
This is a common occurrence when finishing in very light
air against a current. To avoid penalty or disqualification,
be careful not to use your engine until you have cleared
the line.

14. Eccentric Tactics
There are some interesting tactics that crews have used
when racing at night. During the 1980 Southern Ocean
Racing Conference Lipton Cup, Harold Cudmore was
skippering Mistress Quickly. He was close on corrected
time to Kialoa, which was ahead of him closehauled on
starboard tack, and to Ondine, which was slightly behind
and to leeward of Kialoa. Ondine tacked, and, as she
passed between Kialoa and Mistress Quickly, Harold
doused the light that illuminates the jib. Anyone watching
from Kialoa and not seeing any light from Mistress
Quickly as Ondine passed (they were too far apart to see
running lights) would assume that Mistress Quickly had
also tacked, and was blocked from view by Ondine. So
Kialoa tacked to cover, and Mistress Quickly secretly
sailed on toward the Florida shore still on starboard tack.
By being able to break cover, she was able to beat Ondine
boat for boat and Kialoa on corrected time.
Another, not too legal, use of lights employed to outfox
an opponent originated on the Great Lakes in the 1950s. A
boat was equipped with a rheostat that regulated the bril-
liance of her stern light. When the crew had their arch
rival tucked behind them, they would gradually diminish
the intensity of the light so their competitor would think

-- 130 of 136 --

Eccentric Tactics 123
he was being left behind. The crew of the lead boat would
see flashlights flashing, and hear winches turning, in-
dicating that all sorts of sail adjustments were being made
on the following boat. Since the latter was actually mess-
ing up their sail trim instead of improving it, the lead boat
would in reality start moving out. The intensity of the
stern light was then adjusted upward. Their competition
now believed the adjustments made were helping them
gain back lost distance when the opposite was true.
The best tactic I’ve ever heard of I’ve saved for last. Dick
Tillman was sailing in the Brigade Sailing Championship
at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. He could only
win the series by putting a boat between him and the boat
immediately behind, which would be first overall by
finishing second to Dick. The third-place boat was too far
behind for Dick to use the most common tactic of dropping
back to camp on the wind of the second place boat, thereby
slowing the boat sufficiently to allow the third place boat
to catch up and to pass. Some other tactic had to be initi-
ated. The idea struck Dick to finish on the wrong side of
the committee boat, and to lure the second place boat
along. The possibility of this happening seemed good,
since the course included numerous mark roundings, and
the finish line was not clearly defined. In any case, he had
nothing to lose. Thus, Dick “finished” while still covering
the second boat close behind, and as they crossed the in-
correct line Dick congratulated him for taking the series.
He then chatted with the “winner” from leeward and
closer to the committee boat until the third boat was close
to “finishing.” Dick then sheeted in, and returned to the
course. He shouted to the third boat that he (Dick) had
finished incorrectly and that they should follow him to the
correct side of the committee boat. They did so before
Dick’s real competition realized what was happening.
This tactic gave Dick the required boat and the series.
Fascinating tactics like these make the sport of sailboat
racing a varied and interesting one. However, until the
racer starts thinking in terms of besting his competition
actively and aggressively with tactics, he isn’t really rac-
ing. Here’s to years of true sailboat racing for the reader
of this book.
