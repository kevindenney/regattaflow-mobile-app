and can afford to get closer. If the buoy’s to port (as in
Figure 8, position B), we’re already over, and had better get
down to the proper side before the gun goes.
The best starting skippers are those who have complete
control over their boats. They know its turning radius so
that they can swing around the stern of another boat. They

know how fast they can stop the boat by backing the main-
sail, and how much lee helm this will give them. They
know how fast they can accelerate to avoid a windward
boat from driving over them. I once watched Arthur
Knapp at the start of a “frostbite” race in dinghies. He

placed his boat right at the committee-boat end of the line
in about 12-15 knots of wind. By trimming, luffing, moving
his weight, raising and lowering his centerboard, and ju-
dicious helmsmanship, Arthur was able to keep his
dinghy within three feet of the same location. Boat after
boat tried to hang in there with him, but drifted off to
leeward. At the gun he took off with the best start.
There still comes a time when no matter how good your
timing or ability to maneuver your sailboat is, you get
caught in a bind, and can’t avoid going across the line
early. For example, you may want to luff up to kill your
speed, but the committee boat or a number of individual
boats are in the way and thwart your intentions. You may
then decide to run down along the line, but some leeward
boats are there holding you up. There is no way to avoid
being early. This generally happens when the starboard
end is well favored, and boats are approaching almost at
right angles to the line. Instead of the port-end buoy’s
being well forward of abeam and only,a small dip needed
to keep from going over early, the buoy is actually almost

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
