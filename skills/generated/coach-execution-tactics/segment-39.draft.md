of the fleet on port tack, find a hole to leeward of a group
of starboard tack boats, and tack into it. As you sail toward
the line on starboard, watch for any port tack skipper who
has his eye on that patch of open water to leeward of you.
Without breaking the rule on altering course, head down
at him. This will force the port tack boat to sail even far-
ther off the wind, closing the distance between the two
boats faster. If he still intends to tack, he will have to do
so earlier. Since you are reaching with good speed, you
should be able to drive over the top of the leeward boat,
which is going slowly after the tack. The altering course
rule provides that the right of way boat shall not so alter
course as to prevent the other boat from keeping clear, or
to obstruct her while she is keeping clear. If the starboard
tack boat changes course early enough and then holds a
steady course, she is not in contravention of this rule. This
alteration of course is one risk the port tack boat is taking
and should be aware of.
There are some rules that specifically don’t apply at
starts. One in this category is rule 42, “Rounding or Pass-
ing Marks or Obstructions.” A leeward boat on starboard
tack that is squeezing to round the port-end buoy as in
Figure 34, cannot call for buoy room to the windward boats
if the starting mark is surrounded by navigable water. If
she has luffing rights, she could make room for herself by
luffing the windward boats. But in the diagram as drawn,
the leeward boat only has an overlap (her mast is aft of the
windward boat’s helmsman), so she can luff no higher
than closehauled, a course she is already on. Being
squeezed out, her only choice is to pass on the wrong side
of the mark, make a circle and try again.
Let’s place the leeward boat in the position shown in
Figure 35. Here, boat A can presumably luff boat B head

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
