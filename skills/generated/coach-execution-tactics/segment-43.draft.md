> 4. Wind Shifts on

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

the Weather Leg
After starting and clearing the line, the first weather leg
is of crucial importance. Boats are still relatively close to
one another, and the wind is chopped up by numerous
sails. Other than boat speed, which we are not including
in our discussion of tactics, the one major difference be-
tween skippers is how they play the wind tactically.
There are two basic types of winds. One tends to shift
back and forth, but maintains one mean direction. We call
this an oscillating wind. The:other wind has small shifts
back and forth, but the mean wind travels either clock-
wise (veering) or counterclockwise (backing). We call this
a continual shift. A study of meteorology will tell you what
type of wind to expect from a given weather pattern. The
oscillating shift is symptomatic of an unstable air mass—
cold air over a warm body of land or water. The warm air
near the surface rises and the cold, heavier air falls to the
surface. Because of surface friction and the rotation of the

earth (Coriolis effect), the upper air in the northern hemi-
sphere is more usually veered than that at sea level. Ina
typical cool northwest wind, the upper air hits the surface
in gust cells that fan out as they travel along. On some days
the wind shifts caused by these gusts are quite regular and
can almost be timed. The skipper who tacks on every
header will easily outdistance those who sail through the
shifts or who are “out of phase” and tack on the lifts. Boat
A in Figure 39 tacks every time she is headed, and is al-
‘ ways sailing on a lifted tack. Boat B sails on one tack

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
