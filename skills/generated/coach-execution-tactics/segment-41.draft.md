tack; boat B must keep clear. The onus of satisfying the
race committee that she kept clear lies on boat B, which
responded, “You tack.”
Though we have been discussing an obstruction that is
the anchorline of a starting mark, this same rule applies
for all obstructions. An obstruction can be a vessel under-
way, such as a starboard tack sailboat or any object that
can be passed on one side such as a shoal.
The rule about hitting a mark applies at the start also.
A boat that touches a starting mark after she begins rac-
ing, which is from the time of her preparatory signal, or
causes a mark or mark vessel to shift to avoid being
touched must retire immediately, unless she alleges that
she was wrongfully compelled by another boat to touch it
or cause it to shift, in which case she must protest. (If the
other yacht accepts an alternative penalty as prescribed in
the sailing instructions, the protest is not necessary.) She
also has another choice. She can exonerate herself by com-
pleting one entire rounding of the mark, leaving it on the
required side, and thereafter re-rounding it or re-passing
it without touching it. The boat in Figure 38 on page 52 has
touched the buoy at the port end of the line two minutes
before the starting signal. Since she is racing from her

starting signal, she is liable to the provisions of the rule.
Had she hit the mark earlier, before her preparatory sig-
nal, she could have ignored it. The penalty rounding can-
not commence until after the starting signal, otherwise it
could hardly be considered a penalty. At the port end of the
line the buoy must be circled in a counterclockwise direc-

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
