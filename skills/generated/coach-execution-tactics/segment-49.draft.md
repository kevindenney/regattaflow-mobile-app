and thus head them. We noticed they were being headed,
and though we were not closehauled and could have
squeezed up ten to fifteen degrees, I decided to reach off
for speed. What happens is shown in Figure 44. The posi-
tion lines in the original wind are much farther apart than
the position lines in the new wind. This indicates how
much distance we caught up.
The tactic is apparent: When you expect a header, foot
(sail fast) for it. Figure 45 shows three boats equal to one
another in the original wind. Boat A sails closehauled
while B foots off for speed. When the heading shift arrives,
the new lines of position show that boat B has gained con-
siderably over boat A. Even if B remains closehauled (the
dotted lines in Figure 45), she would gain on A when the
shift arrives because she is closer to the side of the race
