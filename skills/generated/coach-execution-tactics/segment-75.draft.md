him should be done very early and sharply. Don’t climb
up his stern and then decide to pass, because you'll be
luffed right off the course. When you are still a few boat
lengths back, go up sharply. If you’re lucky, the skipper
of. the boat ahead won’t notice your move until it’s too
late. When there are one or two boat lengths of open
water to close before the leeward boat can effectively luff
a windward boat, leeward may not even try. By the time
he gets up to you, you may very well have a mast abeam
position, and the leeward boat would be unable to luff
legally. By closing the gap in attempting to luff, the lee-
ward boat is now sailing slower, in a more disturbed area
of your wind shadow.
Most skippers
	who
	have experienced
	these
	problems
won’t
luff
unless they
have
a
good chance
of
holding
off
the
windward
	boat.
They
	realize that the
greater distance
	the
two boats
are apart, the
quicker
the
windward
	boat’s skip-

mast
	abeam
	position. In
Figure 56A

and wind-
ward responds, but
	still
	hasn’t
	reached mast abeam.
	In
Figure 56B there
	is
more space between
	the boats.

same
	luff
and the
	same response

windward’s
helmsman’s being far

her proper course.
There are times when the tactical interplay between
boats on reaches is done at long distance. Chris Bouzaid,
President of Hood Sailmakers (U.S.A.) Inc., recounts what
he calls his favorite ocean racing maneuver. He has used
this tactic on two One Ton Cup Championships, and it is

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
