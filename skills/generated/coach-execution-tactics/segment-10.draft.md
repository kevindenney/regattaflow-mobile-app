next race? During the 1976 Olympic Trials I saw Dennis
Conner and Con Findlay planing back to the harbor in a
fresh breeze with spinnaker set after a race. Con was flat
out on the Tempest’s trapeze, pumping the spinnaker
sheet, and Dennis was aggressively playing every wave
and hiking out hard in every gust. Their competitors must
have been impressed at the strength, agility and intensity
of the two. It certainly could mean a difference in a head-
to-head confrontation in the next race.
There are other tactics that are simply practical jokes,
and if you are taken in by them, you should kick yourself.
A large nut with a cotter-pin hole in it is laid near the base
of the mast of an ocean-racing yacht before a race, and a
crew member discovers it. A panicky search for the bolt
from which the nut fell off is initiated. A man is sent aloft
in a bosun’s chair to inspect the mast, and energy is ex-
pended over this one nut, which detracts from race prepa-
ration.
During a Mallory Cup eliminations we switched boats
with another crew for a second race, as is common prac-
tice in this type of round-robin series. The spinnaker ap-
peared to be prepared, neatly packed in its container as if
the previous crew had forgotten they were to switch boats.
Our skipper was a little smug that a competitor was so
“out-to-lunch” as to do our work for us. Since the foredeck
was my responsibility, I wasn’t about to set a spinnaker I
hadn’t packed, so I dumped it out of the container. Under-
neath the neatly folded covers of the sail on top, the spin-
naker was tied in knots. Though I can’t imagine doing that
to another competitor, I only have myself to blame if I’m
taken in by such shenanigans.
We'll cover more psychological tactics later in conjunc-

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
