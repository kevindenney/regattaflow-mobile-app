to an opponent’s tack. By watching the wave patterns, the
covered boat can choose an intermittent smooth patch of
water in which to accelerate rapidly after tacking. The
covering boat simply tacks upon seeing the leeward boat
tack, and is often in worse wave conditions.
Dick Stearns, a legendary Star sailor, worked over Tom
Blackaller in an interesting manner during a Bacardi Cup
Star Series. Though Dick had good boat speed, Tom was
well upwind and covering in the normal way. They had a
shifty offshore breeze of 15 m.p.h. Dick watched the hull
of Tom’s Star closely. When Tom appeared to be lifted,
Dick tacked. When Tom tacked to cover, he was now sail-
ing in a header. Since the wind shift took a few moments
to travel down to leeward, Dick had a few degrees of head-
ing advantage until the new wind reached him. By repeat-
ing this procedure over and over, Dick ate up Tom’s lead.
Sometimes you can cover from ahead and to leeward,
such as when there is less adverse current along a lee
shore. Bruce Goldsmith “covered” Gordon Lindemann
during a Soling Midwinters in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, by
footing toward the shore out of the current. Gordon’s style
was to point high, but pointing just kept him a longer time
in the current. By sailing fast but low, into less current,
Bruce could end up to windward and ahead of Gordon
every time around the course. Just as you should foot to
headers, foot also to areas of less adverse current.
Once a covering position has been established, the boat
being covered generally tries to break the cover—to get
free air and even to turn the tables, to become the covering
boat. One way already mentioned is to initiate a tacking
duel. If this tactic isn’t helping, try a false tack. If the
covering boat is starting his tack at the instant you start
yours, a false tack can sometimes work. Act just as if you
are planning to complete the tack, but abort it when head
to wind. The windward boat has completed his tack, and

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
