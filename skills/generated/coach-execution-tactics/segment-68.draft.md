# RegattaFlow Coach Racing Tactics Core Concepts

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Roundings
The greatest area of congestion in a race is at the start,
but the next greatest is at the first weather mark rounding.
The boats that can spurt out of that mess in good order
stand a good chance to lengthen their lead on the bulk of
the fleet. When the second leg is a spinnaker reach and
there’s a bunch of boats clustered close behind you, con-
sider delaying the spinnaker set and reaching high to
avoid having them on your wind. When they fall down to
course and set spinnakers, do the same. When there’s a
large space of open water between you and the boats be-
hind you, the opposite tactic is usually the best: turn right
down to course, and set the spinnaker quickly to lengthen
the distance between you and your pursuers. They will
probably luff each other up high of the course, and, along
with having to sail a longer distance, they will have to sail
on a slower point of sail to get down to the mark.
