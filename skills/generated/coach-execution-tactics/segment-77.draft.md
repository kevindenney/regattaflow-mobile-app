# RegattaFlow Coach Racing Tactics Core Concepts

## Focus
> 10. Leeward Mark

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

As the leeward mark is approached on the second reach,
it’s again desirable to get an inside overlap. In Figure 57,
boat A is trying to get to weather of boat B for an inside
overlap at the mark. Boat B luffs sharply, and, as the two-
boat-length circle is approached, boat B falls off toward
the mark. Often this turn can break the overlap and place
the windward yacht in a “clear astern” position, defined in
the rules as “when her hull and equipment in normal
position are abaft an imaginary line projected abeam
from the aftermost point of the other’s hull and equipment
in normal position.” As the leeward boat turns toward the
mark, this imaginary line swings forward, and the overlap
is broken.
There is another option that is often used when you don’t
care about the rest of the fleet, and there is only one oppo-
nent you must beat. The leeward boat may carry the over-
lapped windward boat to the wrong side of the turning

mark, but there are a number of provisions in the rules
that must be met: (1) the leeward boat must have luffing
rights; (2) before she is within two of her overall lengths
of the mark, she must hail the windward boat that she
plans to take her to windward of the mark; (3) she must
begin to luff before she is within two of her overall lengths
of the mark; and (4) she must also pass to windward of the
mark. This last requirement has been interpreted to mean
she must cross an imaginary line perpendicular to the
mark and the course from the last mark, before turning
back to reround properly. Because there are so many res-
trictions on this tactic that must be fulfilled exactly by the
leeward boat, it isn’t often used. However, I’ve done it suc-
cessfully downwind at a finish line against a windward
boat that would have just barely beaten me had I con-
tinued straight across.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
