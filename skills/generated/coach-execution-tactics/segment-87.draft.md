## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

realized he wouldn’t get through us to weather. This also
made the proper course to the mark farther by-the-lee.
Desperado then attempted to obtain an overlap to leeward,
and we immediately fell off for the mark. To avoid jibing,
and thereby fouling Desperado by jibing too close to her,
we held our boom out over the side of the boat. Desperado’s
crew did the same, which played beautifully into our
hands. Desperado was a three-quarters rig with a tremen-
dous mainsail, while Sleuth is a masthead rig with a high-
aspect-ratio mainsail. Holding the respective mainsails
out against the wind slowed Desperado far more than
Sleuth. Even though Desperado was a much faster down-
wind boat, we successfully held her off at the mark.
Maintaining starboard tack by holding the boom over
the port side of the boat is a standard tactic. The “Defini-
tions” in the racing rules state: “A yacht is on the tack
(starboard or port) corresponding to her windward side.
The leeward side of a yacht is that on which she is...
carrying her mainsail. The opposite side is the windward
side.” It doesn’t matter that the wind is coming over the
“leeward” side of the boat as long as the mainsail is out
over that side. Be aware that a jibe isn’t completed until
the mainsail fills normally on the other tack. If it isn’t
completed, you are still in the process of jibing, and you
have no legal rights over a boat that is on a tack.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
