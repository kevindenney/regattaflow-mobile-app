Always remember that the race committee may move
the buoy between starts of various classes, or may change
the position of the committee boat. Since it’s difficult to get
a range in the last five minutes before the start, watch to
see if the line is being changed. An outboard motorboat
puttering around near the buoy, a person in the bow of the
committee boat near its anchorline, general recalls in pre-
vious starts, or a bunching of the fleet at one end of the line
in earlier starts are all indicative that the line may be
adjusted, negating the range you took.
Often the race committee places a stake boat at the far
end of a long starting line to aid in calling the boats that
are over early and are blocked from the view of the com-
mittee boat (see Figure 5). If done properly, the stake boat
will anchor right on the extension of the line, and one
crew member will sight the line through a vertical pole or
mast as in Figure 6. You can use the buoy and the vertical
pole as a range. The delightful aspect of this range is that
it is already made for you.
At the committee boat end there also is a ready-made
range. One person sights the line from behind the vertical
mast or pole that constitutes the committee-boat end of the
line. If you are near that end, it’s very easy to tell if you are

on his line of sight. At the start of the 1979 Transatlantic
Race from Marblehead to Ireland, I reached up on star-
board tack to leeward of the fleet. Alliance, to windward,
could have possibly blanketed us, but she was killing
speed because the helmsman thought he was early. I could
see that the man “calling” the line was sighting far ahead
of our bow, and I pushed on ahead. This allowed me to hit
the line right at the gun, get the best start in the class, work
out in front of Alliance, and give the crew a good boost for

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
