right up with a light breeze, and their momentum took
them right through us to the mark. The tables had turned
on us completely, and we were almost last. The mass of
boats stalled at the mark when they doused their spinnak-
ers. I saw a stronger breeze filling in from windward. A
couple of the leaders had broken free from the group, and
they were moving out closehauled in the freshening wind.
I elected to stay well low of the jumble of boats, and, with
the pole on the headstay, to sail with the spinnaker on as
tight a reach as possible. We broke through the lee of the
largest bunch, doused the spinnaker well past the mark,
and hardened up. We then tacked on to starboard, which
took us directly toward the new wind. Most of the group of
boats that were stalled at the mark took our stern on port
tack, and we were back in decent position, having gained
back about ten to twelve boats.
When there is a strong current against you in light air,
consider a late spinnaker douse. The boats ahead that
have doused too early now find themselves with too little
sail area to stem the current, and the rest of the fleet is
catching up under spinnaker and blanketing the boats
ahead. To avoid this situation, assuming that you are ei-
ther leading or have a clear shot at the mark, carry your
spinnaker right up to or even past the mark if the current
could set you onto the mark as you round. When you reach
a position where the current will just about set you to the
proper side of the mark if you lost your way, douse the
spinnaker. For the small amount of delay going to wind-
ward, you are at least sure of having cleared the mark.
Normally, if current and other boats are not a worry, the
proper mark rounding is to swing wide in the beginning,
and thus be close to the mark at the point where you are
closehauled. Boat A in Figure 58 has made a smooth, even

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
