and often even the best get disoriented after a wind shift.
If the wind veers clockwise and they reach off with the
apparent wind slightly forward of abeam, they will be
well high of the reaching mark. I’ve heard that even Paul
Elvstrom sailed to the wrong reaching mark in one pre-
Olympics. Inevitably, the fleet follows, since the best sail-
ors are usually in front, and most of the others think the
leaders must be right. It’s interesting to look at what tal-
ented sailors do when they realize they’ve made a mistake
or discover the mark isn’t where it ought to be.
Peter Bordes was leading a Thistle race on a low visi-
bility day, and suddenly realized that the mark was al-
most dead to leeward. He had been close-reaching much
too high, and the fleet was following. If he headed dead
downwind on a run toward the mark, the rest of the fleet
would spot it, and cut the corner on him. They would still
be reaching at a fast clip while he would be running. He
had a great idea. He told his crew to throw off the main
halyard, as if it had broken. As the mainsail came tum-
bling down, he stood up in the boat swearing at his bad
luck. The fleet sailed by enjoying the scene. As the last
boat passed, his crew raised the mainsail, set the spin-
naker, headed for the mark, rounded first, and won the
race.
Jim Mattingly had a similar problem in the 1971 Half
Ton Cup World’s Championships. He was leading the fleet
on a reach, realized the mark was to leeward, but noticed
a fog bank to windward. He pretended to see the mark to
weather, and hardened up under the spinnaker. The fleet
followed him into the fog bank. As soon as Jim’s boat was
well hidden from the rest, he jibed and finished the race
hours ahead of the other boats.
Hans Fogh found himself in a somewhat similar situa-

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
