quarter. Stuart, in the port tack boat, bears off early to go
under the starboard tack boat. This forces the starboard
tacker to cross because a safe leeward is unobtainable. To
avoid obstructing the port tack boat, the starboard tacker
can’t start tacking to cover until the port tack boat’s bow
crosses her stern. Stuart, in the port.tack boat, tacks im-
mediately after she passes astern to meet the starboard
tacker tacking simultaneously. When two yachts are tack-
ing at the same time, rule 41.4 says the one on the other’s
port side shall keep clear. By using this tactic, the port tack
boat may force the other back onto starboard tack, as in
Figure 50, and drive over her.
This tactic seems to work best with dinghies, but has
been tried on boats as large as twelve meters. Dennis Con-
ner was skippering Freedom in the 1980 America’s Cup
Trials. While sailing on port tack, Freedom ducked under
Clipper on starboard tack near the layline. As Tom Black-
aller, helmsman of Clipper, tacked to pin Freedom, Den-
nis Conner started to tack simultaneously. However, Tom
just did a sweeping, slow tack and cleared Clipper’s bow.
Tom knew the rules, recognized the trap Dennis was try-
ing to lure him into, and adjusted his tactics accordingly.
Luffing is a common defensive tactic to prevent another
yacht from passing to windward. Because this tactic is
rarely used when beating, it tends to be forgotten as an
option. There are times when a good luff on a beat can be

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
