shows the time remaining at various stages.
As we approach the line, we might find ourselves early.
By coming up toward the committee boat, as in position B,
Figure 18, we have to travel a longer distance to the line,
which helps eat up the time remaining. If the time is badly
misjudged, we can luff up higher, as in position C, and can
also slow the boat down by letting the sails luff, which we
can’t do when running. As long as we have an overlap on
a boat to windward, we can luff up along the line, and they
must respond. They cannot curtail the luff even if their
helmsman is forward of our mast, unless we luffed above
a closehauled course, which is not very likely under the
circumstances. The windward boat can only curtail my
luff if an obstruction, a third yacht or other object, restricts
its ability to respond. Because of the anti-barging rule, the
committee boat doesn’t qualify as an obstruction or “other
object” in this example.
This brings us to the danger involved with our approach

if early. If we have chosen a point on the line too close to
the committee boat, and we have a number of boats to
leeward of us who are also early, we could run out of line
before the gun. We can’t bear off across the line, because
we will foul the leeward boats. Possibly we can luff up
behind the stern of the committee boat, but there’s bound
to be some “spoiler,” such as boat A in Figure 19, who is
trying to mess up the port tack starters by approaching on
starboard. Boat B is in big trouble, and I’1l leave the reader
to figure out how she gets out of it unscathed. The only
answer I have is: Don’t get yourself into that position in the
first place.
When the wind is far enough aft, so that the starboard
tack can be easily carried to the line (see Figure 20 on page

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
