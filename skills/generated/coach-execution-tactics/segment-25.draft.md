The difficulty rests in that it can often be hard to slow
down if you’re early, yet it’s deadly to be late. Upwind you
can recover faster from a bad start by tacking for clear air
and playing wind shifts better than your competitors.
Reaching or running it can take “forever” to get past other
boats, even if they’re smaller, when they have had a better
start than you.
When the wind is in the direction shown in Figure 18,
my general tactic is to choose a point on the line where I’d
like to be at the gun. I then time it to be at that point on
a beam reach at roughly two minutes to go, providing
there’s a good breeze. Since it’s a reach, we pick up speed
very quickly after the turn to return to the line, so a shorter
time sequence can be used. With light winds I would use
a longer time sequence, because it takes longer to pick up
speed. I would also sail more downwind, more parallel to
the line, so as not to diverge from it very far and to make
our approach when returning a tighter reach for greater
speed. After reaching away from the line something less
than a minute, we jibe or tack and head back for an equal
amount of time.
The Vanderbilt timing system shown in Figure 18 on
page 30 could well be used in this instance. We cross the
line at two minutes (120 seconds) going away. We add the
time it takes to jibe or tack, say 20 seconds, and divide by
two (120+20=140~2=70). At the moment our watch says
there is a minute and ten seconds (70 seconds) left before

the start, we begin our tack or jibe. When we complete it,
the time remaining on the watch (50 seconds) is the same
as the time elapsed to the start of the jibe or tack. This is
probably made clearer by looking at Figure 18, which

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
