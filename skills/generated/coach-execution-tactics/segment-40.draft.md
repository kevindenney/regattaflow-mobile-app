to wind since her mast is forward of B’s helmsman. How-
ever, the helmsman of boat C is forward of A’s mast, so A
cannot luff above a closehauled course if the luff will
affect C. Rule 38.6 states that a boat shall not luff unless
she has the right to luff all boats which would be affected
by her luff.
A rule that could affect starting yachts is rule 43,

“Close-Hauled, Hailing for Room to Tack at Obstruction.”
An obstruction is any object large enough to require a
yacht, when not less than one overall length away from it,
to make a substantial alteration of course to pass on one

side or the other. In Figure 36, the mark is an obstruction,
and windward boat B is not required to tack at leeward
boat A’s request. If A hails for room to tack, B must inform
her that she is not entitled to it. Being in a bind, A may hail
again, and, having received room to tack from B, must
retire or accept an alternative penalty when so prescribed
in the sailing instructions. If boat B refuses to respond to
A’s initial hail and then fails to fetch the mark herself, B
must retire or take an alternative penalty.
By definition, the ground tackle of a mark is not consid-
ered part of it. If the race committee boat has a long an-
chorline out in front of it, the obstruction created by the
anchorline is not part of the mark, and another section of
the rule applies. Boat A in Figure 37 does have the right to
request and to receive room to tack from boat B. She is not
allowed to hail and to tack simultaneously. Boat B has two
choices: she can tack at the earliest possible moment after
the hail, in which case boat A must start her tack before
boat B completes hers. If A cannot tack without colliding
with boat B, A must tack as soon as she can clear her. Boat

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
