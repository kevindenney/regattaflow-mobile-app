through a lift, a header, a second lift, and a second header
before she tacks. We are assuming both boats sail within
45° of the wind, the wind shift is 20° each time, and they are
sailing at the same speed through the water. It is clear that
boat A has gained a commanding lead over boat B in a
relatively short distance.
The continual shift can be just as impressive if played
correctly. We touched on it briefly in choosing the end of
the starting line nearest the expected shift. The continual
shift is associated with a stable air mass. Southerly winds
bringing warm air over cooler water or land cause a strat-
ified condition as evidenced by smokestack emissions’
flowing parallel to the land rather than rising.
In Figure 40, boat B starts off in the direction toward
which the wind is expected to shift, and boat A sets out on
the other tack. Boat A gets lifted, feels good about it, and
continues on. At position 3 they both tack. Now boat A is
sailing in a header and boat B in a lift. The difference is
that A’s header is much worse than when boat B was sail-
ing in a header and B’s lift is much better than A’s original
lift. If A had gone much farther before tacking, she would
have lost far more distance. When you find yourself sailing
what we call “the great circle” in a continual lift, the
sooner the decision is made to tack to get over to the good
side of the course the more the losses are cut. It takes a
great deal of fortitude to do this, because it’s easier to hope
that the wind will shift back again, head you, and give you
a lift on the other tack.
Many sailors know the foregoing theory of wind shifts
very well, but have trouble spotting them on the race
course and remembering how to use them properly. There
are various ways to spot and to use windshifts. After long
experience some of the best sailors can tell a shift direc-

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
