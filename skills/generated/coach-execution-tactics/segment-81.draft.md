a much greater header on starboard, since he must remain
on starboard tack for such a greater distance.
The approach to the weather mark for rounding to a run
demands different considerations from those of rounding
to a reach. It usually does not pay to hold high after round-
ing, except to clear your air, because you lose so much
distance by not heading directly downwind at the mark.
This is particularly so when the course to the leeward
mark necessitates a jibe. If we’re leaving marks to port and
the wind has shifted, as shown in Figure 60, the long tack
upwind will be starboard, and the run will be on port. Just
remember “starboard tack up, port back” and vice versa.
As you approach the weather mark, a decision must be
made as to which tack to run on. If the wind is fairly
parallel to the course and the next leg is almost directly
downwind, the starboard tack makes the most sense for
port roundings. Since you are approaching on starboard,
it’s easiest to set up the spinnaker pole for that tack. A jibe
set is usually slower, and on larger yachts there’s more
that can go wrong (e.g., the spinnaker’s wrapping around
the jib during the jibe). :
Another disadvantage to having the pole and spinnaker

The Beat toa Run and the Run 105
all set up for a jibe to port occurs when you have ended up
outside of other boats at the mark. I have seen boats in this
position, held off by inside leeward boats, unable to jibe to
port because the leeward boats were on starboard tack.
The outside boat has to wait until the others have cleared
out ahead before she is able to jibe past their sterns to set
her own spinnaker.
A boat that takes the port tack after rounding sails into
the congestion of sailboats approaching the weather
mark, whereas starboard tack takes the boat away. The
congestion can cause two problems: (1) all the closehauled

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
