momentum is tremendous. At the start in the next to last
race of the 1979 Antigua Race Week, I was sure Sleuth’s
number was up. The buoy end was favored. As we ap-
proached the line, the seventy-nine-foot Kialoa, along
with two other “maxis,” Mistress Quickly and Condor of
Bermuda, was overtaking us at twice our speed. Kialoa
came within two feet of hitting our starboard quarter. As
she headed up to avoid us, she collided with Mistress
Quickly, and went over the line early. Sleuth was being
held up by a boat to leeward, and there was no place we
could have gone to avoid the mess. Because so many boats
were over the line early, there was a general recall signal,
and we had to go through the whole procedure again in the
20-25 knots of wind prevailing at that time. My first reac-
tion was to thank God we hadn’t been hit or had someone
hurt. My initial plan for the restart was to be cautious and
conservative. It then occurred to me that every other skip-
per must be feeling the same way, and I resolved to “go for
it” on the restart. The buoy end was still the place to be,
and we were there right at the gun. As I suspected, we were
all alone and had the best start.
If you’re on a Starting line where there is no land or stake
boat for a range and you're starting near the middle of the
line, there’s still a way to help you judge the distance from
it. Before the start get the compass bearing of the line. Sail
out beyond the line. Then sail toward the buoy, lining it up
with the flag on the committee boat. On port tack, as in
Figure 7, the bearing is 100°. It follows that the bearing on
starboard is 280°. There are times when we are reaching
along the line on starboard tack to avoid going over early.
If we sail a course of 280° and the buoy is off our starboard
bow (as in Figure 8, position A), we’re still short of the line,

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
