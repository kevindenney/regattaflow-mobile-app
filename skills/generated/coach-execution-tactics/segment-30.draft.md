on the right side of the course, as depicted in Figure 26.
Most sharp competitors know that if they tack immedi-
ately after the start, they will be gradually headed on port
tack as they approach the shore. After tacking they will get
a starboard tack lift along the beach. Since the race com-
mittee doesn’t want a whole pile of hot competitors sailing
at their transom at the start, they place the buoy end way
upwind in order to coax a large portion of the fleet to start
at that end. It is very tempting, because, at least initially,
a boat at the buoy end has a decided advantage over one
at the other end. However, as the boats sail into the new
wind, that advantage is lost, and the boat that gets into the
new wind first gains the most distance. Note that boat A on
starboard tack in Figure 26 on page 38 crosses boat B near
the shore. She never would have crossed boat B if she had
taken starboard tack from the starting line.
If it looks as if there will be a large bunch of boats start-
ing at the starboard end, and it’s necessary to get on port
tack to reach the wind shift, only the one or two boats
nearest that end will get a good start. The others will have
to sail on starboard away from the shift until the wind-
ward boats tack. This being the case, a boat that ap-
proaches the line late, but right behind the boat nearest
the mark, will get the second or third best start in the fleet.
She will be clear to tack as soon as she passes the commit-
tee boat, assuming it’s at the starboard end of the line.
Another time you might

“favored” end

the line
is
when
	the
wind
	is
shifting back and
	forth. Let’s
say the
buoy end
	is
currently upwind,
	but,
by testing the
wind before the start,
you have noticed that the wind
	is as

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
