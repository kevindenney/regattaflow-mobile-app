Breaking Cover, and
Luffing
Often a skipper is concerned about only one other com-
petitor. On the last windward leg to the finish, it may be
the nearest boat. In the last race of a series, it could be the
competitor who is closest in points. Or perhaps it’s just the
perennial foe who is always nearby and forever hard to
beat. Many races are lost by not covering opponents when
the chance exists. A typical example occurs when a boat
on starboard tack crosses an opponent on port and fails to
tack to cover. If the finish line is nearby, sailing farther
before covering (“splitting tacks’) is a very risky business.
Any little wind shift can cause positions to change. The
proper tactic is to stay between your opponent and the
finish line, sailing in the same direction and, therefore, in
the same wind.
The desired spot on a beat is dead enon Though you
actually lose distance on any wind shift, as shown in Fig-
ure 46, you are still ahead and in a position to keep your

opponent from passing. In position A, one boat is dead
upwind of the other, and the leeward boat will have to sail
six units of distance to be in the same position as the wind-
ward boat. A large header comes, as in position B. The
leeward boat tacks immediately, and has only five units to
sail. In position C a large lift again puts the leeward boat
closer, this time by a little over five units. Smaller wind
shifts make the loss smaller, but it’s still there. It’s possible

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
