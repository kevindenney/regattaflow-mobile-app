## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

In many ways sailboat racing tactics are constantly
changing and evolving just as our society changes and
evolves. In fact, many recent changes in racing rules re-
flect the change in society’s attitudes. There was a time
when sailboat racing was a casual Saturday afternoon
affair between gentlemen. If a sailboat hit a racing mark,
the skipper retired from the race, period. As the attitude
toward racing became more competitive and winning
more important, some skippers decided to take the chance
of disqualification rather than retire after hitting a mark.
The injustice of this came to a head during the 1968 Olym-
pics in Mexico when Carl van Duyne, the U.S. Finn class

representative, hit a mark during one of the races. No one
saw the accident, but Carl did the honorable thing... he
retired. A few races later, a competitor from another coun-
try brushed a mark with his sail. Other Finn sailors and
even the international judge stationed at the mark saw it.
He didn’t retire, was protested, and was not disqualified
because he vehemently denied hitting the mark. Since the
rule depended on the honor system, the competitor’s word
outweighed observations by others. This incident, more
than any other, led to the change in penalties for hitting
a racing mark. No longer must a crew retire or be dis-
qualified. Now they may reround the mark after hitting it.
This incident is, however, also symptomatic of both a
gradual deterioration of the moral fiber of society and a
changing attitude toward the importance of winning.
Many today seem to believe that winning is more impor-
tant than abiding by the rules. One youngster at an Opti-
mist Pram championship was asked why he had brought
two rudders. His unabashed reply was that the second one
was designed for sculling when the wind is light. Sculling,
the rapid back-and-forth movement of the rudder to pro-
pel the boat forward, is clearly illegal, but it is in wide-
spread use in smaller dinghy-type sailboats. Also illegal is
rocking (rolling the boat from side to side), pumping
