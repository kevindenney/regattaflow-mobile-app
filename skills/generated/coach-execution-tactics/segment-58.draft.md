the
layline
to
the
weather mark, and cannot
	tack
because
of
the
	proximity
	of
a
boat
	on
	your
	weather
	quarter.
	You
have
a
safe
leeward
	position
on the boat,
and
normally
	the
skipper
	would
	tack
away
	to
avoid
	sailing
	in
your
	bad
	air.
This
	time,
however,
	you
	are
pinned
	and
	can’t
tack
for
the
mark
	until the
weather
	boat
	does.
	If
you bear
	off
to
gain
tacking
	room
	to
leeward,
	so
does your
	opponent
	to
keep
you
	from
	tacking.
	Only
when
	he can be sure
	of
laying
the
mark
	will
he
tack,
and then
there
is
no
way
	for
you
to
lead
to
the
mark.
The
	situation can be
saved by
a
well-timed
	luff
short
of
the layline.
	I
was
	once
	crewing
	in
the
Mallory
	Cup
	elimi-
nations
	in
Ensigns.
	We
	found
	ourselves
	in
just the situa-
tion
described
	above.
	Brit
Chance,
	also
crewing, suggested
a
	luff.
	The
	late
	Palmer
	Sparkman
	was skippering and
agreed.
	Knowing
	that the
	luff
would
	be
	almost head
	to
wind,
I
released
	the
jib.
The
windward
	boat
was caught by
surprise.
	The crew
	failed
	to
release the large
overlapping
jib,
which
	backed, forcing the boat over
	to
starboard
	tack.
We
kept
on sailing
a
few boat lengths
to
the layline, tacked,
and met
	the other boat on port tack
at
the
mark. Since the
latter
	had
	to
duck under
	our stern,
	we rounded ahead.
There
	are those
who consider such
a luff
bad sportsman-
ship. I disagree when
	it’s
for a
defensive purpose such
	as
