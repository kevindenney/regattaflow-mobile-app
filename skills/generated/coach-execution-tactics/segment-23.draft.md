because she is reaching in from an area above the close-
hauled course (indicated by the dotted line), boat A is also
barging because boat B, with luffing rights, can deprive
her of room at the committee boat until the starting signal
is made (at which time boat B must not sail above close-
hauled, or above the first mark to deprive boat A of room).
Figure 15 shows what the result might be a few seconds
later, before the gun.
With current set (see Figure 16), however, it’s far more
likely that boat C will find room. Whereas boats A and B,
being closehauled, can’t point any higher to adjust for the
contrary current, boat C is far more flexible, and can head
up from her reach right to the end of the line, leaving boat
A with no chance to squeeze C out.
When current is running in the opposite direction (see
Figure 17 on page 28), carrying the fleet toward the starting
line, the reverse is true. There can be an awful mess of
boats near the line, all being pushed over early by the
current and by leeward boats reaching down the line in an
attempt to avoid going over early. In:this case the most
leeward boat can get, if not the best, at least the safest start.
There are various methods to determine the velocity and

other anchored yachts to see if they are heading straight
into the wind. If not, there is some current running. This
observation is fine in light winds, but will not be discern-

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
