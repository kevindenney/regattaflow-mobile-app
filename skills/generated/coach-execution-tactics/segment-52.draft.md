## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

you’re dead on his wind by the time you have picked up
momentum after the tack. Tack too late, and the other boat
will have a safe leeward position on you. Tack too early,

him
	to
tack,
he
will
have
a
clear safe
leeward
	on
you
when
he
does.
The
	covered
	boat has
a
number
	of
options open
	to
break
the cover.
	One
	is to
initiate
a
tacking
	duel,
which
	can end
up
	in
one
	of
three ways:
	(1)
the
covering
	boat
	is
worried
about
	losing
	to
others
	in
the
	fleet
and breaks
	off,
(2) the
covered
	boat tacks
	and accelerates
	faster,
so
the
covering
boat
	loses
	ground and decides
	not
to
continue
	tacking,
	or
(3) the
covered boat loses
ground
	for the
same reason and
sees no future
	in
continuing
	the duel.
The covered boat has the
advantage
	of
having
the choice
of
when
	to tack,
whereas
	the covering boat can only react
