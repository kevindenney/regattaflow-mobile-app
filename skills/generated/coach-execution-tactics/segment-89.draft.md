## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

The tactic that consistently accounts for the most places
won or lost at an upwind finish is sailing to the downwind
end of the line. Just as the upwind end of the line is fa-
vored at the start, the downwind end is favored at the
finish.
In the 1968 Olympics, I saw Buddy Friedrichs, the U.S.
skipper in the Dragon class, take four sterns and still
finish first. Buddy was on port tack laying the starboard
end of a long finish line. He met four other Dragons on
starboard tack, one after another, and ducked under the
stern of each. Rather than tacking on him, they all con-
tinued toward the port (buoy)-end of the line. By choosing
the downwind end, Buddy went from fifth to first in a
couple of hundred yards and won the gold medal.
Unfortunately, it’s very difficult to determine which end
is downwind. You don’t have the same opportunity as at
the start to take the bearing of the line, and to compare it
with the wind direction. However, there are a few tactics
that can help.

Finishing 117
As you approach the finish, you have four laylines to
deal with: port and starboard tack laylines to the port end
and both laylines to the starboard end. The four laylines
are shown with the wind square to the line (see Figure 68).
You never want to sail past the first layline you reach. A
starboard tack boat will tack on the port tack layline to the
starboard end. A port tack boat will tack on the starboard
tack layline to the port end, as shown in Figure 68.
In Figure 69 on page 118, the wind has veered making
the port end downwind by a good margin. As two boats
approach the intersection of the two laylines, it is obvious
that boat B will have a much shorter distance to sail than
boat A. The buoy will seem closer than the committee boat.
Distances are deceiving when you are comparing two
objects of such disparate size as a buoy and a yacht. Fur-

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
