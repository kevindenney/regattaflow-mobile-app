we converged with Aries again we crossed her handily,
having taken a short-term disadvantage for a later gain.
Buddy Melges, Olympic medalist, Star and Soling world
champion (among other championships), says, “Put your
head one hundred yards in front of your boat.” In effect,
that’s what we were doing.
In Antigua Race Week, Sleuth and Aries seemed to have
somewhat comparable speed upwind. At the start of an-
other race, I elected not to try for the ideal position right
at the committee boat, because the starting line was closer
to shore than in the preceding example (see Figure 30 on
page 42). I estimated that we would have to tack so early
after the start to avoid going aground that we wouldn’t be
able to clear starboard tack boats, and we might be forced
back in toward shore. So we played the start a little farther
down the line. As we approached the shore, Aries called

for water. She had to tack to avoid going aground, and
couldn’t without fouling us. We tacked at her request as
required by the racing rules, and she tacked immediately
(also as called for by the rules). This put her right in
Sleuth’s backwind. As we both came out on port tack,
Aries, slowed by our dirty air, failed to cross Fandango on
starboard (just the position I was worried about getting
into at the start), and was disqualified. This is another
example in which possible future situations weigh in your
decision where to start on the starting line.
Sometimes it’s important not only to decide where on the
line you will start, but also where you will practice. Arthur
Knapp found that novice racing sailors were always

getting tiresome, so he’d make practice starts at the wrong
end of the line and draw all the neophytes to that area. At
the last moment he’d hightail it to the preferred end, and

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
