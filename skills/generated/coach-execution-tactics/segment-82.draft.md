boats, whether on port or starboard tacks, have right of
way over the boat running free on port tack; and (2) all the
closehauled boats on the starboard tack layline, to wind-
ward of the running boat, disturb the wind terribly. In
light air the running boat’s spinnaker can be well blan-
keted by these closehauled boats.
Once around the mark, it’s crucial to keep away from the
blanket zone of another boat. In light winds the zone of
disturbed air carries for quite a number of boat lengths
downwind from the windward boat. The helmsman of the
windward boat will try to stay “on the wind” of the lee-
ward boat by keeping his masthead fly pointed right at the
leeward boat. At times it may be necessary to reach up a
little for extra speed to get the leeward boat in your blan-
ket zone. Doing so makes the distance between the boats
greater and your blanket less effective. But some blanket-
ing is better than none, and you should still be able to slow
the leeward boat enough to start gaining back the lost
distance.
It’s often best to stay out of luffing matches on the lee-
ward leg. When you and another boat are in a luffing
match on a reach, the luff is still somewhat in the direc-
tion the fleet is sailing. A luff on a run may take you at
right angles to the course. While the fleet is sailing toward
the mark, you are making zero progress toward it. Further-
more, when you curtail the luff and fall back down to
course, you will have to sail lower than the rest of the fleet,
which will have a better point of sailing on you.

Figure 61
On a run, you use the benefits of blanketing mainly to
close the distance and to catch the lead boats, but it usually
takes a jibe or two to get through safely. In Figure 61 the
trailing boat has gradually cut down the lead of the lead-
ing boat by disturbing her wind. At position A the lead boat

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
