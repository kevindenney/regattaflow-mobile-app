## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

about all these facets of racing would make this book un-
necessarily cumbersome, we’ll consider tactics as “the
means to win in proximity with other sailboats,” as op-
posed to winning against the clock.
By this definition certain types of boats are sailed less
“tactically” than others. For instance, in catamarans and
other extremely light, fast boats, speed differences are
measured in many knots rather than fractions of a knot.
If a slight gust of wind can accelerate a boat to 15 knots
while a competitor is doing 10 knots, more will be gained
by sailing toward an area having more wind than by cov-
ering the competitor. Catamarans are notoriously difficult
and slow to tack. If you decide to tack to cover a competitor
to weather, and your boat slows almost to a halt as you do
it, it’s virtually impossible to time the tack correctly. By
the time you complete the tack, the opponent, sailing at 10
knots, is long gone. These boats depend largely on great
differences in boatspeed to win races.
If boats are so evenly matched in speed that races must
be won by other considerations, they become “tactical”
designs. Most one-design classes of keel boats fall into this
category. In non-planing keel boats where speed differ-
ences between competitors are marginal, more depen-
dence upon tactical interplay is necessary. This is not to
say there are no tactics involved in racing catamarans or
centerboard boats. They are just at different levels on the

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
