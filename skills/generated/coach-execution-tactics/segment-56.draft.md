One can even break the cover from a boat behind with
a little thought. A few years back I was crewing on Carina
in Long Island Sound. Toward the end of a two-day race,
we were “rock hopping” along the shore shortly after
dawn to pick up the light offshore breeze. We noticed that
Baccarat, about half a mile to leeward, matched every
tack we made to stay as close to shore as we were. The

tacks weren’t random. They were covering from behind.
When we tacked toward shore, they also tacked. When we
tacked away from shore, they tacked at the same instant.
Feeling we could put such predictability to good use, we
started poring over the chart. We noticed in one area that
the ten-foot bottom contour took a long passage toward the
shore (Figure 49) so we sailed out on port tack until we
judged that Baccarat was opposite the channel. We
tacked, and, true to form, so did Baccarat. We then sailed
in as far toward shore as possible, and tacked when our
centerboard touched bottom. Baccarat tacked and

promptly went hard aground on an outgoing tide at the
“X” in Figure 49. We sailed away until she was out of sight
astern, still aground. Lest the reader feel we were some-
how playing with danger, let me reassure him that going
aground in mud along the Long Island shore is a common-
place occurrence, and no danger or damage is possible on
light days.
Dr. Stuart Walker, the great author of sailing books, told
me of a tactic he has used successfully to break a cover
almost before it happens. He worked this tactic sailing his
International 14 dinghy in a team match. A port tack boat
in a team match expects a crossing starboard tacker to
tack and to cover—either on her lee bow or on her weather

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
