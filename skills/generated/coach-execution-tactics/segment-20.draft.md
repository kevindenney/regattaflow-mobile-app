line to start on starboard tack. When the starboard end is
upwind, the reverse is true (see Figure 11). Tack, if possi-
ble. You’re going to have to go back to the line on port tack
anyway, and a tack takes you much closer to the favored
end.
There are a few other factors that can change your tim-
ing and mess up a perfect start. One is current; the other
is a change in wind strength. A combination of the two can
transform a small mistake into a disaster. When the
breeze is very light, the percentage of wind-strength
change can be great. A 2-knot breeze is doubled with a
4-knot puff, a 100 percent velocity change. A 15-knot wind
only increases 33.3 percent in a twenty-knot puff. Since
wind force on the sails quadruples as the wind velocity
doubles, you can see how important the puffs and lulls can

be at the lower speed ranges. The problem in timing the
line often comes from a light wind that is dying. A boat
that strays too far away from the starting line in a light
breeze may end up in a hole, and take an hour to get back.
I’ve seen it happen. While all the other starters hugged the
line, one boat sailed to a point three minutes away from
the starting line in a light breeze. As luck would have it,
the breeze died where she was, but held near the line. By
the time she finally started, the fleet was rounding the

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
