Ill still have over a minute on final approach. This is
enough time for even a fifty-four-footer to pick up speed.
Most other boats are using a longer pattern, four to six
minutes. They are coming back on starboard to start while
I’m still going away. If it looks to me that the first batch of
boats is very early, I just let them go by, and find a hole to
leeward and ahead of the group that appears to have
timed it correctly. If we all appear to be early as we ap-
proach the line, I have the option to luff them up to slow
the boat down. If, however, we’re all late, I have room to
fall off to drive the boat faster.
With a closehauled start, it’s important to know just
what heading you can make on each tack. Let’s say you
want to start on starboard tack at point A, as in Figure 1.
You have determined previously that you can sail 330°
closehauled on starboard. As you sail away from the line,
you take rough compass headings on the committee boat.
If you find that the bearing has changed from 020° to 350°

The Start 13
too quickly, it means you will pass the 330° course well
before you need to jibe or to tack back for the line. This
will possibly place you in a dangerous barging position
(for an explanation of barging, see page 25). Fall off to run
more parallel to the 330° course, to converge with it more
slowly. You are now sailing farther away from the line, so
you will have to turn back earlier than before to cover the
greater distance involved. In addition, you will have to
adjust your course for other boats to avoid having them
either directly to windward of you when you return or on
your leeward quarter, where they can force you over the
line early. All these course adjustments mean changes in
your timing. For me, it is easier to judge the time it will

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
