immediately behind, which would be first overall by
finishing second to Dick. The third-place boat was too far
behind for Dick to use the most common tactic of dropping
back to camp on the wind of the second place boat, thereby
slowing the boat sufficiently to allow the third place boat
to catch up and to pass. Some other tactic had to be initi-
ated. The idea struck Dick to finish on the wrong side of
the committee boat, and to lure the second place boat
along. The possibility of this happening seemed good,
since the course included numerous mark roundings, and
the finish line was not clearly defined. In any case, he had
nothing to lose. Thus, Dick “finished” while still covering
the second boat close behind, and as they crossed the in-
correct line Dick congratulated him for taking the series.
He then chatted with the “winner” from leeward and
closer to the committee boat until the third boat was close
to “finishing.” Dick then sheeted in, and returned to the
course. He shouted to the third boat that he (Dick) had
finished incorrectly and that they should follow him to the
correct side of the committee boat. They did so before
Dick’s real competition realized what was happening.
This tactic gave Dick the required boat and the series.
Fascinating tactics like these make the sport of sailboat
racing a varied and interesting one. However, until the
racer starts thinking in terms of besting his competition
actively and aggressively with tactics, he isn’t really rac-
ing. Here’s to years of true sailboat racing for the reader
of this book.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
