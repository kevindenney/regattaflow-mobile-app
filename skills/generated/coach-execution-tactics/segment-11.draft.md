## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Without doubt, the most important contribution to the
final result of a sailboat race is the start. There are three
prime ingredients in making a good start: (1) to be on the
line at the instant of the starting signal, (2) to be at the best
location on the line, and (3) to have clear air. These three
components guarantee a good start, but they are far more
difficult to achieve than one may realize.
The first involves a sense of timing. There are usually
ten minutes in the starting sequence. Under one system, a
white warning signal goes up ten minutes before the start,
and comes down six minutes before. At five minutes, the
blue preparatory shape goes up, and at one minute before
the start it comes down. At the start a red shape is dis-
played. Most crews use a stopwatch to keep track of the
time elapsed, but I’ve also heard of people using a tape-
recorded countdown. Of the two types of stopwatches,
sweep second hand or digital, the latter is fine if a crew is

calling out the time remaining to you, but the sweep sec-
ond hand gives a much better feeling of time. It’s usually
best to have two stopwatches going in case one gets
stopped by accident. The person taking the time should
start the watch at the signal rather than the gun. Often
when the starting line is long, the signal cannot be seen at
the moment it goes up, and the smoke from the gun must
be used. The noise from the gun will take too long to reach
you to be reliable for timing. If you miss the timing, be
sure to get it when the shape comes down.
Keep track of the color of the shapes and the order of the
start of the various classes. Otherwise you could miss your
start. Dick Deaver of North Sails once used a competitor’s
confusion over the starting sequence to his advantage. He
was in a match race series, pairs of boats racing against

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
