near the buoy end of the line, and to observe the water
flowing past the mark. The mark will appear as if it were
being dragged upcurrent, and it will create a wake behind
it when the current is strong. Look for impurities in the
water such as bits of paper, twigs, or even bubbles flowing
past. To be more scientific, drop a “current stick” into the
water next to the buoy. A “current stick” isa piece of wood,
or aluminum tube, weighted to float vertically. It is prefer-
able that it be equal in length to the draft of the boat. If so,
it will be affected by the same current affecting the boat.
The weight should be heavy enough to allow only a very
small portion of the stick to be above the surface of the
water. Thus the wind will not affect its travel to a large
extent. After dropping the stick, sail around for about a
minute, and then pick it up, noting how far and in which
direction it drifted from the buoy. Knowing that a nautical

mile is roughly 6,000 feet and a “knot” is the speed neces-
sary to cover one nautical mile in one hour, we know that
a knot of current will carry the stick 100 feet in a minute.
If you are sailing a thirty-foot boat and judge that you’re
about three boat lengths (ninety feet) from the mark when
you pick up the current stick a minute later, you know that
the current is almost one knot. Moreover, you know the
rough distance you will have to allow for, to be on the line
at the starting signal if the current is carrying you away
from the line.
Up to now we’ve discussed windward starts. Timing lee-
ward (running or reaching) starts so that you hit the line
at the gun is slightly different and, in a way, more difficult.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
