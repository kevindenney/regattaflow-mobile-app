right of way rules, so I couldn’t defend myself. That night
I started studying the rulebook, and found that (1) the
protesting skipper hadn’t jibed at the first reasonable op-

portunity, (2) he had luffed without luffing rights, (3) he
had failed to fly a protest flag, (4) the protest was not in
writing, (5) the protest was not made within two hours of
the finish of the race, (6) a reasonable time was not al-
lowed for the preparation of a defense, and so on, and so
on. I swore never to be so unprepared again.
I soon learned, in regard to luffing after starting, that a
leeward boat can luff only a boat that is passing to wind-
ward. A leeward boat cannot overtake to leeward and then
luff. If, at any time during an overlap, the helmsman of the
windward yacht is abeam or forward of the mainmast of
the leeward yacht, the latter shall not sail above her
proper course while the overlap exists.
When a boat does attempt to pass you to windward, you
can luff that boat head to wind if you desire. As two boats
turn toward the wind, however, the outside leeward boat
has farther to turn and so loses ground on the inside wind-
ward boat. If the leeward boat’s mast comes abeam of the
windward boat’s helmsman, he calls “mast abeam,” and
the leeward boat has to fall off to her proper course to the
mark. There are a few tricks that have been outlawed.
Windward’s helmsman must be in his normal steering
position, and cannot lean way forward so as to call mast
abeam earlier. Nor can he point the boat higher than the
leeward boat to get the same result. If leeward’s helmsman
feels the call of mast abeam has been premature or other-
wise improper, the only recourse is to protest. Further,
leeward’s helmsman can luff only if he has luffing rights
on all boats affected by the luff. Keep this in mind the next
time you are being luffed. I’ve often stopped a leeward boat

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
