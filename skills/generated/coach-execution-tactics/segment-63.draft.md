## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

A variation on this theme is when the port tack boat is
crossing ahead of the starboard tack boat. Since the latter
is on the layline and doesn’t want the port tack boat to feed
her bad air all the way to the mark, she heads off about ten
degrees and maintains a constant course so as not to ob-
struct the port tack boat. When the opponent tacks in a
safe leeward position or dead in front of the starboard tack
boat, the latter heads up to closehauled and drives over the
top of the boat that just tacked.
By remembering your compass course the last time you
were on starboard tack, you can take compass bearings on
the mark, and tack when it bears the same as your last
reading on starboard. This assumes no windshifts or cur-
rent, but these can be cranked into your calculations. For
instance, if you’re sailing in a ten-degree header on port
tack, add ten degrees to your last heading on starboard
tack and use that for a bearing.
Skippers of many boats paint laylines on their decks
based on their normal tacking angles. Let’s say your boat
sails within 45° of the wind and tacks in 90°. A line painted
abeam (90° from the centerline of the boat) indicates the
layline. When the mark is on an extension of that line, a
tack will place you right on the layline. Often other lines
are added 45° forward and aft of the layline, as in Figure

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
