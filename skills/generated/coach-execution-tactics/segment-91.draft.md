## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

finish line’s being square to the wind and being square to
the course from the last mark. In the past the line was
always supposed to be square to the course regardless of
wind direction. Though this change cuts down the amount
one end of the finish line can be favored over the other, it
doesn’t alter the fact that if the wind shifts to the right of
the course, the port end should be downwind and vice
versa. As you sail up the last weather leg, therefore, keep
in mind the true wind direction. If the port tack takes you
closer to the finish (the long tack), then the wind has
backed, and the starboard end is downwind.
Finishing tactics involving other boats are used either to
pin them away from the line or to force them onto the
unfavored tack more parallel to the line. Figure 70 on page
120 shows the finish line approach of Whirlwind and
Sleuth in one race. As Whirlwind came at us on port, we
normally would have tacked ahead of her and a little to
windward. However, this would have allowed her the pos-
sibility of pinching up above us and curtailing our ability
to tack across the line, since we would be tacking too close.
She would then tack when she could clear the buoy, and
possibly nip us at the finish because the buoy end was so
heavily favored. The timing of the tack was crucial.
Sleuth is a large, heavy boat and doesn’t pick up speed
very fast after a tack in a seaway. Sleuth’s tacking too early
would allow Whirlwind to stick her bow to weather be-
tween us and the mark as we gathered momentum. Our
tacking too late would allow her to drive through our lee
and luff us as we struggled to get speed up. Her speed, if she
shot into the wind for the line, would probably have carried
her across ahead of Sleuth. My tack had to be completed

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
