over one starting at the committee boat. Assuming two
boats can sail within 45° of the wind at the starting signal
and each starts sailing upwind on opposite tacks toward
the other, Figure 22 shows how far ahead the port tack
boat will cross the starboard tack boat. The line is only
thirteen boat lengths long, the wind is 30° off of square, and
boat A already has a six-length lead over boat B. In this
case the buoy end is “heavily favored.”
What happens if the windward mark is way to the right,
and there is a shorter straight-line distance to the mark
from the starboard end of the line than from the port, the
upwind, end? In Figure 23, an arc described from the
windward mark through the committee boat clearly

shows that the buoy end is farther away from the wind-
ward mark. But the wind still favors the buoy end so much
that when boats A and B have both covered six units of
distance, boat A has retained a commanding lead. A few
assumptions are made here: that there is no difference in
the speed of the boats, that there are no wind shifts and
that there is at least one tack involved in the weather leg.
If it were just a reach from the starting line to the weather
mark, then the shortest geometric distance would proba-
bly be the fastest route to take.
Given that we want to be at the favored end, how do we
tell which end of the starting line is favored? My prefer-
ence is to determine the compass bearing of the line as we
did in Figure 7 by lining up the buoy with the starting line
flag on the committee boat. Let’s say we get 135° for the
line. If the line is absolutely perpendicular to the wind, as
in Figure 24, by subtracting 90° we get a wind heading of
45°. If, however, when we point the boat into the wind, the

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
