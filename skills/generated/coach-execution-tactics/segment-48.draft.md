## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

breaking through our backwind. In retrospect I realized
that we both had been slightly headed, and Peter was con-
solidating our lead by utilizing the lift on port tack. By
getting to windward of A, any future lift would not work
to our disadvantage as before, and there would be no
chance of our competitor’s passing us to windward.
Watch boats to windward of you on a beat. Headers and
lifts will hit them first, and as the shift is traveling down
to you, quite a bit of distance can be gained by using the
proper tactics. Boat A in Figure 43 sees that a boat to wind-
ward of her has been lifted, but A is still sailing in the
original wind. If A keeps on sailing, she will be in position

A,

	the

arrives.
	If
she
	tacks twice,
	she’ll
	be
	in
position
	A,
when
	the
	shift gets
	to
her.
	By drawing
	lines
perpendicular
	to
the
wind
	direction,
	we
	can
	see
that
A,
is
farther
upwind
than
A,.
To
the best of
my knowledge
	Peter
Barrett
originated
these
lines
back
in
the
sixties,
and
calls
them
	“lines of
equal
	position.”
	Any
boat
on
	a
beat
	that
is
on the
same
	line
(perpendicular
	with
the
wind
	direction)
with another
boat
or
boats,
is
the
same
	distance
upwind
	as
the others.
Boat A,
by noting
that
a
lift
is
expected,
realizes
that
she
is
sailing
in
a
header.
	Even though
	it
may
	be the
highest
	compass
	course she has
	sailed on that
tack
up
to
this point,
it
is
still
a
header

vis
the course she
will
be sailing
	when
	the
shift
	reaches
	her.
	Thus
	the
prudent
rule of “tack
	in
headers”
	still
holds.
Often distances can be gained by observing
	a
boat
	to
windward
	being badly headed.
	In one
	St.
Thomas
	Rolex
Cup
	race the course ran
	through
	a
pass
	between
	two
	is-
lands with high
terrain.
	A
boat
ahead and
to
windward
	of
us
held high through
	the pass expecting the
wind
	to
veer

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
