stant jibing. It was common knowledge that a good, solid
pull on the mainsheet in light air during a jibe would scoot
a light boat forward faster than just letting the boom come
across on its own. Some years ago I was crewing a Thistle
in the midwinters at St. Petersburg Yacht Club. We were
sailing toward the finish line downwind in first place with
the second place boat’s bow even with our transom. Sud-
denly he did two fast, violent jibes, which propelled him
to a first-place tie with us. Though we felt this was morally
wrong, his argument was that he decided to go for the
other end of the finish line and then changed his mind. It’s
easy to find some justification for a series of jibes or tacks.
This situation, though, has become exaggerated, with
some competitors in dinghies doing fifteen to twenty roll
tacks from the starting line to get ahead of the others.
The result is that dinghies can now be taken off the list
of tactical boats. If one tacks to cover another, the latter
can, by rocking, pumping, sculling, unweighting (bounc-
ing up and down), or torquing (bearing off, heeling, and
hiking out hard as you come back up to course), nullify the
effectiveness of the cover. All of these maneuvers are es-
sentially illegal, but are widely used.
How far should a sailor go to win? At a recent regatta it
was discovered a number of boats were sabotaged.
Spreader bolts had been sawed halfway through so that a
heavy wind would cause masts to be lost. The hope was
that vandals had done the damage because no one could
believe another competitor could or would stoop so low.
The truth has not yet been uncovered.
A few years ago two teenagers were racing a small cen-
terboard boat. After numerous capsizes in heavy winds
one of them could no longer get back into the boat after
righting it. He slipped away and drowned. It was discov-
ered that they had been carrying lead weights in their
pockets to make them heavier for hiking out in total con-

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
