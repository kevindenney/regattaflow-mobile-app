to avoid being pinned to the layline. I don’t particularly
like the skipper who luffs in an attempt to “tag you out.”
The rules allow a sharp luff without warning, and if
there’s contact, the windward boat is usually either dis-
qualified or penalized. Some skippers use the rule to luff
all over the course without any apparent purpose except
catching the windward boat unawares. Generally, if you
are the skipper of a windward boat that is luffed and
tagged by a leeward boat, you should be annoyed at your-
self for putting your boat in such a vulnerable position,
rather than at the leeward skipper for exercising his
rights.
The one spot where the proximity of boats makes it diffi-
cult to avoid a sharp luff is right after rounding a mark.
Let’s say you have an inside overlap at a mark. The outside
boat gives you just enough room to allow you to round
safely. This puts you in closer than you would normally be
in case of a luff. Since you are placed in this vulnerable
position through no fault of your own, you must be partic-
ularly wary.
It was just such a situation that was the impetus for me
to learn the racing rules well. I was about sixteen years
old, and had borrowed my father’s Atlantic-class sailboat
for a Saturday afternoon race at my local yacht club. I was
approaching the leeward mark on a port tack run, and my
bow was almost overlapped with the stern of an older
member’s boat on starboard tack. He sailed right past the
mark without jibing. I swung inside and hardened up
around the mark, whereupon he jibed, luffed head to wind,
hit me near the stern about a boat length past the mark,
and yelled, “You’re out!” I disregarded the call and kept on
racing. Two weeks later the race committee chairman
said to me, “Stevie, an incident happened on the race
course a while ago, and the club cannot condone such
behavior.” I was taken before a protest committee and
thrown out of the race. I knew nothing except the basic

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
