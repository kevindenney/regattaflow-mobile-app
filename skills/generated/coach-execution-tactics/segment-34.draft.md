## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

start with less congestion. Naturally, he had timed how
long it would take to sail from one end of the line to the
other. This is good information to have in case you need to
change ends.
Another reason it’s beneficial to know the length of the
line is to help in your judgment of distances. The two ends
of the line are the only fixed points around the starting
area that can give a time-distance reference. Suppose it
takes three minutes to sail from the buoy to the committee
boat. If you’re one-third of a line length away from the line
as you approach to start, you are approximately one min-
ute away. You just have to make allowances for boat speed,
which could have been faster reaching along the line than
on the final approach.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
