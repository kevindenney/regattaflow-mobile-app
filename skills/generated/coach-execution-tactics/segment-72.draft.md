them to be overlapped to the outside of us, so I could head
at the mark with an inside overlap. When it became obvi-
ous that she was going to power over us, I let her go. Run-
ning Tide passed us, and, when she was clear ahead, we
held a course that would take us past the buoy outside the
two-boat-lengths circle. If we had headed for the mark
when we were within two boat lengths, we would not have
been overlapped and would not have been entitled to
room. We would have just followed her around the mark.
The crew on Running Tide obviously wanted to jibe for
the mark, but couldn’t without fouling us in the process.
When we reached the spot shown in Figure 55, well past
the mark, we jibed, and had an inside overlap at the mark

with Running Tide tucked away in our bad air. What this
incident shows is the type of thought processes that must
go on in racing. Many skippers luff any boat passing to
windward indiscriminately, without thought about the
desired end result. Again, put your head a hundred yards
in front of your boat.
Whether to sail high or low of course on a reach depends
a great deal on the anticipated wind strength and direc-
tion. When the breeze is fresh early in the leg and you
expect it to soften, sail low initially. This allows you to
harden up to a faster point of sailing as the wind dies. The
opposite course is taken when you expect a light breeze to
freshen. Head high first, and come off as the breeze
strengthens. With a wind that is steady in direction, but
changeable in strength, fall off for speed in the puffs, and
head up in the lulls. This will also keep you in the puffs
longer as they move downwind.
Current is also a factor on reaches. Generally, in a con-

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
