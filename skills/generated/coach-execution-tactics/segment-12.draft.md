a very poor position. Dick then initiated a tacking duel to
make Jim really think that the race was on. By tacking

and started all alone at the correct signal. By the time Jim
figured it out and sailed back to start correctly, he was a
long way behind.
Dick emphasizes that Jim took it as a good sport, and this
incident shows that even the finest sailors in the world can
make mistakes.
Knowing the time remaining does not necessarily get
