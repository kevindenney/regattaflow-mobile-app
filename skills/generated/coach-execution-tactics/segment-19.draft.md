abeam, and a major alteration of course is necessary.
Aboard Sleuth in the 1980 Antigua Race Week race,
these same circumstances prevailed. We were early, with
Sunbird holding us up and nowhere to go. We could have
dipped a little or killed our speed a bit, but I knew that it
wouldn’t be sufficient to avoid being early since the buoy
end was so far back. So I plowed ahead, knowing we were
over early, but determined to round the committee boat as
fast as possible. We were closest to the committee boat
with Aries and Sunbird to leeward, all three of us going
for the line. They too were over early, and, possibly be-
cause they felt we were blocking the committee boat’s line
of vision, neither returned to start and both were dis-
qualified (Figure 9). Since our rerounding took only 35
seconds, it was not much more of a disadvantage than a
very poorly timed start. The key is to bite the bullet and
reround fast. If you kill your speed, even though you know
the start can’t be saved, two things can happen. First, those
who have timed it properly can drive over you to wind-

	and keep
you
	from
	tacking
	for
a
while, and, second,
you
will
have
so
little
forward
	speed
that the tack
and
jibe
needed
	for
rerounding
	will
be
terribly slow.
Once having
gone
over
the
line early,
too
many
	skippers
sail on,
trying
to
decide
how
	to
get
back
to start.
They may
have
	boats both
	to
windward
	and leeward
	of
them, and
can neither
	tack nor
jibe.
The
	solution
	is to
slow
	the boat
energetically by
luffing
	(both
	heading
	into
	the
wind
	and
luffing
your
sails).
This
will
allow other boats
to
sail
by and
make
	room
	to
leeward.
	You have
all
your
legal rights
until
you
	are
	actually
	returning
	to start.
	Every
	boat length you
sail
away
	from
	the line
	is
another
	boat length you
	must
sail
back. After
turning back,
head
straight across the line

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
