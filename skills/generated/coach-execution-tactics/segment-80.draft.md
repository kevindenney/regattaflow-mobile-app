mark and hardening up to closehauled, check how far
back your nearest competition is. When they have covered
half the distance to the mark, tack. By the time they reach
the mark, you should be dead upwind of them. This places
you squarely between your destination and your competi-
tion. To beat you they have to go “through” you, which is
very difficult.
Some of the greatest gains and losses occur shortly after
rounding the leeward mark. It is essential to know
whether you are sailing in a header or a lift, and to judge
which way you expect the wind to shift. A shift may have
occurred on the second reaching leg, where it’s more diffi-
cult to detect. The apparent wind would go forward, but
this also happens if the breeze lightens, so the skipper may
not have noticed. After rounding and sailing closehauled
for a while, as in Figure 59, he suddenly notices that other
boats, which have rounded long after, are well up inside
of him. While he was sailing on a header, the other boats
were on the reaching leg. When they reached the mark,
the wind backed, lifting all boats on port tack. This put the
boats at the mark in an instantly favorable position vis-a-
vis the skipper who sailed in a header. If he recognizes this
fact, he may keep on sailing on the lift, and wait for the
next header to come before tacking. If he doesn’t realize
what has happened, he may feel his bad position was
caused by poor crew work or perhaps more wind where
the other boats are. This might prompt him to tack, where-

upon he would be sailing in a header when all the others
are sailing in a lift—a bad move.
The solution is to avoid getting into the position before
it happens. If you haven’t been able to determine any wind
shift on the reaching leg, check your compass course after
rounding and sailing closehauled. You should know your
heading on port tack from the last beat, and compare it

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
