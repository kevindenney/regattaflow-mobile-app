especially a genoa, to avoid backing it.
When it becomes obvious that because of current, an-
other boat’s backwind, or whatever, there is no way to lay
the mark, look for a spot to tack early. Even if it’s neces-

sary to slow the boat down to let a windward boat pass, it
may be better than continuing on into an impossible situa-
tion. A windward boat will usually bear off for speed in an
attempt to take the leeward boat’s wind (to blanket her)
even if, by doing so, she fails to fetch the mark. This guar-
antees the windward boat the lead at the mark. If he had
allowed the leeward boat to pinch, or to shoot, to fetch the
mark, the latter would have an inside overlap, and would
probably maintain the lead.
For many reasons, therefore, it’s important to avoid
reaching the laylines too early. About the only disadvan-
tages in arriving at the starboard tack layline very close to
the mark are: (1) congestion, and (2) the short distance on
starboard tack to set up for a spinnaker. The first depends
on the size of the fleet, the length of the weather leg, and
the type of boats. A large, evenly matched fleet of identical
boats can result in a mammoth pack of starboard tack
boats approaching the weather mark for a port rounding.
A port tack boat may have to take fifteen or twenty sterns
before finding a hole in which to tack. On the other hand,
a boat in a class of cruising boats that have finished a
five-mile beat may find no other boat within 100 yards.
The second disadvantage is more important to the cruis-
ing boat. Because of the more cumbersome equipment,
such as heavy spinnaker poles, more time is needed to
prepare for a spinnaker leg than on smaller boats. One has
to approach the layline at a distance from the mark to
allow the crew time to set up, but not so far out that one
either overstands or otherwise misjudges the layline.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
