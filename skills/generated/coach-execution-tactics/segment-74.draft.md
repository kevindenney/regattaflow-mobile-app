# RegattaFlow Coach Racing Tactics Core Concepts

## Focus
> 9. Jibe Mark

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

We are finishing the first reaching leg, and approaching
the jibing mark. When the first reach is broad, the next
reach will be quite tight, and an early jibe is dictated. If
possible, complete the jibe before arriving at the mark so
you are free to harden up to the new course right at the
mark. In this way you will lose nothing to leeward. The
opposite is true if the first reach is tight, but it doesn’t take
much to realize you shouldn’t start the jibe early. With a
tight reach it’s natural to start jibing after arriving at the
mark. :
Though it’s beneficial to be the inside boat at the mark,
there are many times when it just isn’t possible to get the
required overlap before reaching the two-boat-length cir-
cle. When a large number of boats are overlapped, the
outside boats squeeze the inside boats fairly close to the
mark. This prevents the inside boats from playing it wide
at the approach and tight at the turn. When you know you

don’t have a chance for an overlap, a good tactic is to slow
the boat down by collapsing your spinnaker or luffing your
mainsail. Then, swing out wide, and do an early jibe.
Harden up for the mark past the sterns of the overlapped
boats, and go for the opening between the mark and the
stern of the inside boat. It’s risky and takes excellent tim-
ing, but it can be done.
If you round in front of a number of boats, luff sharply
after the mark to discourage any of them from attempting
to pass you to windward. It doesn’t hurt to end up a little
high of course on the second reaching leg of a marks-to-
port triangle, because that will put you inside at the lee-
ward mark. So while we luff with discretion on the first
reach, we luff with vengeance on the second to keep from
being passed.
Knowing that such will be the tendency of an opponent
ahead of you, any luff on your part to get to weather of

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
