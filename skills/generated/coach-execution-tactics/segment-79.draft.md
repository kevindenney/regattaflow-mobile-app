rounding, and is on the wind right next to the mark. Boat
B has approached too close to the mark, drifts out on the
turn, and ends up on the wind well to leeward of boat A.
Since it is doubtful she could tack without fouling boat A,
boat B has gone from a winning position to a losing one.
Naturally, boat B could make a much tighter turn if her
spinnaker were down, and she were prepared for it. How-

ever, since a tight turn results in a large loss of speed, the
result would be the same.
If you do a decent rounding, as does boat A in Figure 58,
but it’s right behind a number of other boats, a common
maneuver is to shoot almost head to wind to gain some
breathing space. Quite often the crew of a boat ahead
hasn’t finished cleaning up after the spinnaker leg, the
boat is heeling too much because the crew isn’t hiking, or
the skipper may not be on the wind because of other dis-
tractions. As long as you aren’t heading dead at the stern
of the boat ahead, you have a good chance of passing. The
luff barely slows you down if it’s part of a continuing turn
around the mark as the centrifugal force of the mast and
sails shoots the boat to windward. With just a half boat
length of open water to windward of the boat ahead, con-
centration on accurate steering and crewing can ensure
SUCCESS.
A luff sometimes doesn’t work if the boat ahead has also
luffed to avoid the backwind of another in front of her. A
tack away from the bad air is often the answer, but will not
be successful if the boat ahead also tacks and covers you.
This is the time to watch carefully for an opportunity. On
some larger day-racing keelboats, a crew member has to
get on deck to clear the spinnaker pole. Sometimes the

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
