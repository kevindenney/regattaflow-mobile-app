has to gain speed before tacking back to cover. For a short
time you are on opposite tacks, which.should be sufficient
to break the cover. Frankly, the false tack never works in
top-flight competition because the covering boat will

delay tacking just long enough to force you to complete
your tack.
Another method is to lead the covering boat into an ob-
struction. The covering boat’s skipper is concentrating
more on the boat he wants to beat than on his surround-
ings. The skipper of the leeward boat can look around for
solutions to his problem because he is calling the shots as
to when the tack occurs. I saw a beautiful example of this
in the 1963 Pan American Games. Pat Duane was the
American Flying Dutchman National Champion. As the
series was drawing to a close, she and the Brazilian entry
were way out front of the other Flying Dutchman skip-
pers. Pat was being closely covered by the Brazilian to
windward in light air on the final beat to the finish line.
They were on starboard tack when Pat noticed the tail-end
boat of the Snipe fleet they were about to lap. He was on
port tack, to windward and ahead of her opponent. Know-
ing that the Brazilian would tack to cover her, Pat timed
her tack so that when he covered, he’d be sailing right
down the transom of the Snipe (see Figure 48 on page 70).
What happened next couldn’t have been foreseen by Pat,
but it clinched the lead for her. The Brazilian decided to
pass to windward of the Snipe, who at the same instant
tacked to get out of the way of the two leading contenders
for the Flying Dutchman gold medal. The Snipe was now
on starboard tack, which forced the Brazilian to tack over
on to starboard also to avoid fouling the Snipe. The two
Flying Dutchmen were now on split tacks, which broke
the cover. When Pat came back over on starboard tack
later, she crossed the Brazilian and won the race.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
