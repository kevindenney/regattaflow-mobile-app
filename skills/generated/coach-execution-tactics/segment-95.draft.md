## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

mate the current direction and strength
Favored end The upwind end of the starting line
General recall When all the starters are recalled for a new start either
because of a timing error or too many boats are over too early to be
identified
Layline The imaginary line which takes a closehauled boat directly to
the windward mark without either overstanding or having to tack
again
Lines of equal position An imaginary line perpendicular to the wind
direction. Any boat on it is equally upwind as another on the same line
and is even with the other.
Luffing Altering course toward the wind
Ooching Sudden movement of crew weight forward or aft
Overstanding Sailing past the layline and having to reach off for the
mark after tacking
Pumping Persistent or rapidly repeated trimming and releasing of any
sail
Rocking Movement of crew weight or adjustment of the sails or center-
board which leads to persistent rolling of the sailboat
Roll-tacking A tacking technique which reduces the period of luffing to
a minimum
Sculling Repeated forceful movement of the helm back and forth
Shooting the wind WHeading the sailboat directly into the wind and
drifting to a stop
Splitting tacks Sailing closehauled on one tack while the competition
is on the other tack
Torquing Rolling the boat to Rar art, thereby increasing the appar-
ent wind in the sails
Unweighting Bouncing crew weight up and down to gain advantage in
waves
Windward (weather) mark The mark that ends the beat

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
