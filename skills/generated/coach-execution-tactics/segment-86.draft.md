new wind direction. She jibes and is on more of a reach,
a much faster point of sail, when the new wind arrives.
This tactic is fine if the wind shifts only a few degrees.
However, if the wind continues to veer so much that boat
A is beam-reaching on port tack, and boat B can’t carry a
spinnaker to get to the mark, the benefits of sailing away
from the shift are lost.
As you approach the leeward mark on a run, it’s very
important to get to the inside of the fleet. It may be that the
right side of the leg was the place to be for wind, but that
won’t be much help if you find yourself outside a stack of
ten boats at the mark. Consider the problem early to avoid
getting caught in the wrong spot. Even if you have to
harden up very sharply and cross a few sterns, it can be of
wind

benefit an Figure 66 boat A has crossed B’s stern, jibes, and
returns on starboard tack with an overlap at the mark.
Boat B’s defense is shown in ,Figure 67, where she also
heads high of the mark. By jibing she breaks the overlap
as the boats turn down to the two-boat-lengths circle.
It’s good fun and a source of satisfaction to keep another
boat from getting an inside overlap at the leeward mark.
During Antigua Race Week on a leeward leg, we, on
Sleuth, were trying to foil Desperado (later lost at sea at-

from obtaining an inside overlap at the mark. We were
running dead downwind on starboard tack, the course to
the mark being almost by-the-lee. Desperado was astern
and to windward. As she approached on our windward
(starboard) side, we held up high, and the skipper soon

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
