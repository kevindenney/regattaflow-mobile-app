crew had to back the jib to swing the bow over fast enough
to avoid hitting the buoy. This necessitated the leeward
boat’s sailing past the mark before tacking and returning
on port tack. In the meantime, Dick had rounded to port,
and had established a starboard tack on the next reaching
leg, just as his competitor was returning to the mark on
port tack. Not caring to add injury to insult, Dick elected
to take his transom and not to protest. After all, Dick had
placed him in that situation in the first place.
Isaw another interesting weather mark tactic in the Pan
American Games. Peter Barrett was sailing a Finn, and
had only one competitor giving him trouble. Peter was on
starboard tack, just barely laying the mark, with his com-
petition about half a boat length dead to leeward. There
were no windows in the sails, so Peter couldn’t see the
other boat. His competition banked on this blind spot, and
sailed right past the mark. He expected Peter to bear off to
a reach around the mark and to foul him since Peter, as
windward boat, had to stay clear of a leeward boat. How-
ever, no such thing happened. Peter kept on going close-
hauled until his competitor realized after fifty yards or so
that there was no future in continuing. Peter obviously
wasn’t taking the bait, and the leeward boat still had to
jibe, sail all the way back, and round the mark. Peter won
the race easily. I asked Peter later how he had figured out
what his competition intended to do. Half, he said, was
knowing his competition. The other half was sensing
something amiss when he had reached the mark, and
could still see nothing of the other boat.
I sometimes approach a layline on port tack, deliber-
ately using another port tack boat to leeward and ahead as
a spoiler. If a starboard tacker comes along that could give
me trouble, the other port tack has to tack first, which can
slow the starboard tack boat down and allow me to cross

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
