# RegattaFlow Coach Racing Tactics Core Concepts

## Focus
> CHOOSING A STARTING LOCATION

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

We have covered the first ingredient of getting a good start,
being on the line at the instant of the.starting signal. The
second is to be at the best location on the line.
With a few exceptions, it pays to be at the favored end
of the line. By “favored” I mean the upwind end of the line .
for windward starts. Most sailboats start a race on star-
board tack, which gives them right of way over any boat
on port tack. When the line is absolutely square to the wind
direction, as in line A, Figure 21, a windward boat with
slightly better timing than a leeward boat should have no
trouble driving over the top (passing to windward) of the
leeward boat. This gives a slight advantage to the wind-
ward boat, and means more boats will bunch up at the
starboard end of the line to secure a windward location. By
moving the buoy up to position B in Figure 21, the leeward
boats are less overlapped by the windward boats and
thereby less disadvantaged. A slight cock of the port end
of the line to windward will tend to spread the boats more
evenly along the full length of the line, and will limit
congestion in any one area.
However, if the port end is well upwind as in Figure 22,
any boat starting at the buoy will have a great advantage

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
