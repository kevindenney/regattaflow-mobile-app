# RegattaFlow Coach Racing Tactics Core Concepts

## Focus
> 6. Laylines

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

A basic tactical rule of sailboat racing is “avoid the lay-
lines.” (The layline is an imaginary line indicating the last
tack to the windward mark.) If you make your last tack for
the mark a long distance from it, many of your options to
take advantage of wind shifts are lost. If you get lifted,
you’ve overstood the mark. This means you have sailed
above the new layline, and you will have to reach off for
the mark. If you get headed, you can no longer lay the
mark and must tack. Every boat closer to the mark gets a
greater advantage from a header than you do. In Figure 51
on page 78, boats A and B were even in the original wind
direction. When headed, they both tack and B has gained.
Moreover, A has only a short distance to sail before she
arrives at the new layline, and has to tack for the mark. If
the wind hasn’t shifted back, she will be sailing for the
mark in a header while B is still on a port tack lift. Boat

D was on the original port tack layline. But when the shift
arrives, boat C is now on the layline while D has overstood.
Another reason to avoid the laylines until a few boat
lengths from the mark is that each boat on the layline is
feeding bad air to the boat behind it. Unless you overstanda
little, the backwind from the boat ahead ‘could be sufficient
to slow you substantially. A slow boat makes more leeway,
which could result in failing to lay the mark. Many skip-
pers start to pinch the boat when this occurs, which results
in more leeway and virtually guarantees a problem at the
mark. The correct tactic is to sail fast and, if it’s close, shoot
dead into the wind to get around the mark. Release the jib,

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
