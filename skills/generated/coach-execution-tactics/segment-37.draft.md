the “luffing after starting” rule apply.
Before the start, the leeward boat cannot luff a wind-
ward boat above a closehauled course if her mainmast is

aft of the windward boat’s helmsman. In Figure 32 boat A
is luffing along the line. Boat B overtakes her to leeward
and initiates a luff. (To luff in this context means altering
course toward the wind.) Boat B’s luff forces boat A to alter
course to avoid a collision. The luff must be carried out
slowly and in such a way as to give boat A room and oppor-
tunity to keep clear. If boat A turns upwind to avoid B and
her stern swings down and hits the leeward boat, she has
some justification in claiming that she wasn’t given
enough room and opportunity to keep clear. In this exam-
ple boat B is unable to luff above a closehauled course
since her mainmast is aft of boat A’s helmsman.
In Figure 33, when boat A’s helmsman sights abeam
from his normal station, it is obvious that he is aft of the
leeward boat’s mainmast. Here, boat B can luff right up to
head to wind as in the diagram, but she still must luff
slowly and give room and opportunity for the windward
boat to keep clear. After the starting signal, boat B can
continue to luff boat A as long as the leeward boat is not
depriving the windward boat of room at a starting mark
(the anti-barging rule). In the incident depicted in Figure
33, the anti-barging rule does not apply.

The ease with which a leeward boat can control you as
the windward boat makes it crucial that you protect your
lee quarter as you approach the line on starboard tack
unless you are late for the start. If you are killing your
speed and a boat attempts to get an overlap to leeward,

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
