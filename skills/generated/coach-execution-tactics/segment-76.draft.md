## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

very effective. Two boats are on a tight spinnaker reach.
The lead boat is eight to ten minutes ahead, and the objec-
tive in Chris’s trailing boat is to close the distance. Chris
first establishes very clearly where the turning mark is. At
this point the mark is not within sight. Because both boats
have been reaching for some time, they have sagged below
course, and eventually will have to douse their spinnakers
to reach up to the mark under jibs.
With about ten miles to go, Chris starts sailing the boat
as high as he can to windward, losing speed while doing
so. Although Chris may be gaining a little weather ground,
the lead boat is assuredly opening the gap between them.
This situation continues for the next five miles, by which
time Chris has made a considerable distance to windward,
but is far behind. The turning mark is spotted, and it
becomes obvious that both spinnakers will have to be
doused for the boats to fetch the mark. At this stage, the
combination of being way behind and well to weather cre-
ates an easy reach to the mark for Chris. The lead boat,
being so far ahead and downwind of the mark, has to go
closehauled to fetch it, and often has to tack. The distance
between the mark and the two boats is almost the same, so
Chris has closed the distance between the two boats con-
siderably with this maneuver.
