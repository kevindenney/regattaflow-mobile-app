by
some
	of the
previous
	examples.
	It
is
a
vital factor.
Figure
31 on
page
44
shows
	the
disruptive
air
patterns
	from
	one boat
and
how
	they
affect
other boats
in
nearby
positions.
Boat
A
is
said
to
have
a
“safe
leeward”
position
on
boat
B.
The wind
	is
bent
aft
by
A’s
sails
so
that
the
wind
direction
to
windward
	of
A
is
slightly
more
	paral-
lel to
her
	course.
	Thus
B
	is
sailing
	in
	a
header, and
	is
unable
to
bear
away
	to
fill
her
sails
because
	of the
proxim-
ity
of
A.
It’s
highly unlikely
	that
B
will
be able
to
pass A,
even
	if
she
	is
a
larger yacht.
The wind
	leaves the
mainsail
	of boat
	A
in
a
turbulent
form
	called
	“backwind.”
	Boats
	C and D
	are in A’s
back-
wind
zone.
Since the efficiency of
a
sailboat’s
sails
depends
in
large part
upon
	the
smoothness
	of the
air
flowing past
them,
	this
	turbulence causes the
	sails
	to
lose their
	lift.
Boats C and D
will
	gradually drop back.
The worst position
to
be in
is
boat
E’s.
This
is
aptly called
the “blanket” zone. A’s sails are
	blocking the
wind from

getting to E in any usable form. What wind there is will be
turbulent, and boat E is in an untenable position.
Just after the start only the boats that are not affected by
others will move out. It’s obvious from Figure 31 that for
every boat with clear air there are quite a number of oth-
ers being hurt. The tactic required is usually either to tack
away, as boat C should do, or foot away to leeward, as boat
E might consider doing. A boat in D’s position must do
something drastic such as luffing her sails and dropping
back fast to tack. It’s slow death to just “hang in there.”

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
