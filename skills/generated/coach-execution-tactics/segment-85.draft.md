## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

One of the most important tactical decisions on a run is
how to play the wind. On a beat we almost always tack in
heading wind shifts. Well, on a run it’s the opposite. We
jibe in lifts. Whereas failure to play the wind shifts prop-
erly on a beat can result in startling losses, the results are
not as dramatic on runs. You will still be heading roughly
toward the leeward mark. In Figure 63 boats A and B are
sailing dead downwind toward the leeward mark on star-
board tack. A new wind that is a lift comes in. It allows
boat A to head up, which she does. Now boat A is no longer
heading directly at the mark. She is sailing a longer dis-
tance on a dead downwind run. Boat B has jibed to port,
and is heading at the mark on a much faster point of
sailing. ;
Let’s say the course to the leeward mark is 195°, and we
know that the true wind was 200° when we rounded the

weather mark (see Figure 64 on page 110). We are sailing
on port tack 20° high of the true wind in light air to gain
more boat speed from a higher velocity apparent wind. We
watch our compass, and keep the apparent wind angle
constant by observing the angle of the masthead fly or our
apparent-wind-direction instrument. Since we head off in
gusts and up in lulls, we have to be careful not to make
decisions based on the different apparent wind velocity.
Our compass shows we have been lifted to 170° with the
apparent wind direction and velocity unchanged. This in-
dicates that 190° is dead downwind, and, since we desire a
course of 195°, the starboard tack is closer and, therefore,
faster.
If the wind shift is continual, you again play it the oppo-
site of a beat. On a beat you sail toward expected headers.
On a run you sail away from them. In Figure 65 on page
110, boats A and B are sailing at equal speed toward the

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
