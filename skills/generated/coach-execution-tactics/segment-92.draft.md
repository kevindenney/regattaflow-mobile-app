man. In this way she’d have no luffing rights, and yet be
pinned to leeward of me. Fortunately, the maneuver
worked perfectly. It’s a fairly standard tactic, but a difficult
one to perform on ocean-racing yachts so close to the finish.
Head reaching, shooting into the wind across the line, is
a useful tactic in trying to nip ahead of a close competitor.
It works only in boats that carry a great deal of momen-
tum, such as large displacement keelboats. It also works
best on light days rather than heavy. When the wind and
seas are high, the boat is stopped quickly by the windage
of the rigging and the force of the seas against the hull.
When you’re about one boat length from the line, shoot
dead into the wind as boat B does in Figure 71. Boats A and

B are equidistant upwind, and would cross the line at the
same instant if both sailed straight. By shooting the line,
boat B slows down, but sails such a short distance com-
pared to boat A that she wins. The timing has to be perfect:
shoot too late and its value has been lost; shoot too early
and you may lose all momentum before reaching the line.
Of the two errors, the latter is more prevalent. Just as
skippers think they are right on the starting line well be-
fore they reach it, so do finishers seem to believe they have
crossed the line well before they actually have. Sail a little
farther than your instincts tell you before shooting.
The racing rule “Definitions” state that “A yacht is rac-
ing... until she has... finished and cleared the finishing
line and finishing marks. .. .” Clearing the finishing line
means the boat is no longer touching any part of it. Since
you finish when any part of the hull, crew or equipment
in normal position crosses the finishing line from the di-
rection of the course from the last mark, your boat doesn’t
have to cross the line entirely to be legally finished. You

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
