# RegattaFlow Coach Racing Tactics Core Concepts

## Focus
> 12. Anchoring

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

There are times when the breeze is so light that the
current overpowers it. Rather than lose precious distance
to the mark, anchor your boat. If you are the first to anchor,
you will stay in one place while the rest of the fleet is
moving backward. I’ve anchored at night and seen us
“passing” running light after running light, just as if we
had double the boat speed of the others. To press the ad-
vantage of being the first to anchor, no one else should
realize you’ve done it. Quietly slip the anchor over the
leeward side near the shrouds, One crew member should
do it while the rest pretend to be racing the boat for all
they’re worth. An anchorline running along the hull is
hard to see, so it’s possible no one will notice that you’re
anchored. Arthur Knapp says this tactic was pulled on
him by Cornelius Shields way back in 1933. It’s been used
a lot since then.

Anchoring 115
An anchor can be used for purposes other than actual
anchoring. I was sailing as tactician on Carina during an
Admiral’s Cup Cowes Week race in England. The start was
in total drifting conditions with a three-knot current car-
rying the fleet across the starting line. Dick Nye, the
owner, asked for my suggestions about starting under such
conditions. There was only one way, in my mind: power to
a location where, when the five-minute gun sounded and
the engine had to be turned off, we would have five min-
utes of drifting with the current to the line. We judged the
distance quite accurately, but failed to get turned around.
We were drifting stern first toward the starting line. All of
the Class 1 fleet was also drifting in a mass to the line,
bouncing against one another and fending off. There was
only one boat heading in the proper direction that had
been able to pick up the slightest zephyr. We had to get the
boat turned around. I called for the anchor to be lowered
over the stern just far enough to drag along the bottom, but

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
