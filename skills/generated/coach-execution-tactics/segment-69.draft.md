is now fairly common: the delayed spinnaker set. When
rounding a weather mark in close proximity behind an-
other boat, sail across the wind on a close reach for a few
moments with main and jib trimmed properly. Assuming
the boat ahead falls right down to course, her speed will
be markedly slowed by the crew’s bouncing around and
the windage of the spinnaker’s going up. Meanwhile the
weather boat gets on her wind, which makes leeward’s
spinnaker more difficult to fly. Once in such a controlling
position, the windward boat sets her chute. That the
process also slows her down doesn’t affect their relative
positions, since the leeward boat is being blanketed. The
obvious defense is for the lead boat to sail on a close reach
to discourage such a maneuver.
Hans Fogh once played the “delayed spinnaker set” in
reverse. In a 1965 Flying Dutchman race in Italy, a Swiss
boat was leading, and Hans was in second place with the
rest of the fleet way behind. The two remaining legs on the
race were close reaches, and to pass the lead boat would
be close to impossible. He figured that if he set a spin-
naker, so would the Swiss. If he luffed to pass to windward,
so would the Swiss... a virtual standoff. So, rounding the
last weather mark to begin the last two reaches, Hans’s
crew made all kinds of commotion, yelling and screaming
as they set the spinnaker. As soon as the Swiss saw the
spinnaker going up behind, he immediately turned his
back and began setting his. Whereupon, Hans pulled his
down, and, when the Swiss’s spinnaker was full, he sailed
right around him to weather (since the reach was so close)
and went on to win the race.
Most race committees attempt to make a 45-90-45 de-
gree right triangle for a course. If the windward leg is
perfect, meaning the wind is blowing directly to the start-
ing line from the windward mark, then the apparent wind
on the first reach will be slightly forward of abeam, and it
will be the same for the second reach. Seasoned racing

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
