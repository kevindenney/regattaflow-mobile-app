luffs up to protect herself, whereupon the trailing boat
jibes and the lead boat follows suit a few moments later.
At position B the trailing boat is still on the lead boat’s
wind, and has an inside overlap at the mark. The mistake
the lead boat made was in not anticipating the jibe of the
trailing boat. By either jibing first or being prepared to jibe
at the same instant, the lead boat would be to leeward with
luffing rights, and could protect her position by luffing.

The Beat toa Run and the Run 107
Luffing can only be done by a leeward boat to prevent a
windward boat from passing. When a boat catches up
from behind to leeward, the reason she cannot luff during
the existence of the overlap is that the helmsman of the
windward boat was forward of the mainmast of the lee-
ward boat when the overlap was established. The overlap
begins when the boats, one of which is no longer clear
astern, are within two overall lengths of the longer one. If,
as they converge, and an overlap is established, the mast
of the leeward boat is forward of windward’s helmsman,
the right to luff is also established.
Another way luffing rights can be established by a boat
that is catching up to leeward is by a couple of jibes. A new
overlap begins after a jibe has been completed. In Figure
62, position B, a boat has caught up from behind, and has

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
