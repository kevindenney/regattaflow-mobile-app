## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

established an overlap to leeward. Because her mast is
behind windward’s helmsman, she cannot luff while that
overlap exists. At position B, she jibes to starboard tack
and back to port at position C. A new overlap is established
at that point. The leeward boat now has luffing rights, for
her mast was forward of windward’s helmsman when the
new overlap was created.
Bob Johnstone, who builds and successfully races the
J-24, J-30 and J-36 class sailboats designed by his brother,
Rod, uses a subtle tactic to shorten the lead of a boat in
front of him on a run. He teases the skipper ahead into
sailing a longer course to the leeward mark. When his
competitor looks back to check on Bob’s position, Bob
steers a little high. The competition steers higher yet. Bob
immediately resumes his previous course to the mark, but
his competitor, having gone higher, takes longer to get
back down to course. Then Bob will exaggerate going low
for a moment while the competitor sails low for fifteen to
thirty seconds. Bob claims this tactic, done repeatedly, is
usually good for three or four boat lengths, or even more,
if you can blanket the boat ahead.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
