## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

by RegattaFlow Coach
Every sailor who strives to win will
want to own this handy volume that
covers every basic of tactical racing and
includes secret tactics as well. Learn the
fundamentals in an illustrated step-by-
step format, and let a master guide you
in developing a personal style of racing
by revealing the special tactics used by
champions.
RegattaFlow Coach, racing sailor, teacher ex-
traordinaire and owner of the renowned
Offshore Sailing School, outlines the
proper tactics for every aspect of racing,
including the start, the finish, rounding
marks, attack and defense. You'll learn
through the definitive text and explicit
illustrations techniques for defending
leads, attacking the lead boat, blanketing
opponents, avoiding collisions, and
more.
And you'll learn the heretofore un-
published secret tactics of not only the
author, but other winning sailors such as
Dick Tillman, Pete Conrad and Bob
Johnstone.
Whether you want to make a “dip
start” maintain a safe leeward position,
gain an advantage by tacking, attain a
“mast abeam” position, or practice more
eccentric tactics, like dousing the jib light
in nighttime racing, you'll find it here.
