## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

• Observe earlier starts. In a multiple fleet event watch
those who go off before you do.
• Pay attention for the first few minutes of the race. If an
advantage is apparent, it is not too late to go after it.
Why is This Side Favored?
Hopefully we will know not only which side is favored, but
why. Knowing the reason will help us determine if conditions
have changed and the advantage has changed as well. If current
is the factor, for example, then a change in the tide can reverse
the advantage. If the advantage is due to the geography of the
surrounding shore, then the advantage will endure until the wind
changes. Knowing not just which, but why one side is favored
will help as we look ahead to plan our downwind strategy.
Right, Left, & Middle
In our discussion of strategy we will divide the windward
leg into three vertical segments; representing the left, right, and
middle of the course. When our strategy favors one side or the
other it is generally best to sail to the right or left of the middle,
but not beyond. There are several reasons to avoid the extreme
sides. For one, our strategy may prove to be wrong and a total

a skewed beat, the favored tack
is not necessarily the long tack.

7.4 Wind Shifts
The second strategic factor is wind shifts. Shifting winds
allow us to reach the windward mark more quickly than we can
in steady winds.
When the Wind Does Not Shift
When the wind is steady then the distance we must sail
to an upwind destination is fixed. We will sail X distance on
starboard tack, and Y distance on port tack to get to the mark.
If the mark is straight upwind, then X and Y will be equal. If
the leg is skewed, then they won’t be equal.
You can sail all port tack, and then tack to starboard, or all

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
