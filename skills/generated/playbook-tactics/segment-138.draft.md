rent. If we look at the performance cones for each sector of
downwind sailing, we can see that in light air the cone is as
wide as the upwind cone. For moderate and heavy air sailing,
the cones are narrower. The reality is that most (too much) of
our racing is done in winds of 10 knots or less. In these condi-
tions our strategic choices are wide. The narrower performance
cones of stronger winds narrow our strategic field.
As with upwind sailing, we are looking for better wind,
and more favorable or less adverse current. We are also trying
to take advantage of wind shifts. Downwind wind shifts are a
major factor, as with upwind, but also differ from upwind in
some interesting ways, as we shall see.
Find more wind!
Favored Side
Downwind differences in wind strength have a more pro-
nounced impact on performance than they do upwind. It always
pays to find more wind. If there was a favored side upwind due
to stronger winds, then sail to the same side downwind (Fig.
3a). An advantage upwind due to current will be realized on the
opposite side downwind (Fig. 3b). Note: the right and left sides
of the course are named looking upwind. The right side upwind
and the right side downwind are the same water.
Light Air Strategy
With a wide cone, but a narrow choice of sailing angles,
light air running most closely resembles upwind strategy. Your
goals should be to find more wind, advantageous current, and
to play the wind shifts. Keep clear air by looking ahead and
behind for open lanes (Fig. 4a).

Moderate Air
As the wind fluctuates in the moderate range, you need
room to roam up and down to maintain optimum performance
(Fig. 4b). Position yourself in front of the puffs, and with room
to work them to advantage. Since jibes (or, I should say, good
jibes) cost very little distance in moderate conditions, it pays to
jibe in search of better wind and open space.
Heavy Air
Whereas in moderate air you must work up and down

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
