## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

If the current is pushing you to leeward you can head up
and sail a faster reaching angle. The current will then push you
down to the mark (Fig. 8).
Conversely, if the current is pushing you to windward,
you must drive off to compensate. It is in these conditions that
your efforts to correct for the current are particularly important.
If you fail to correct for current as it pushes you to windward,
you will eventually have to sail down into it at an increasingly
unfavorable reaching angle (Fig. 9).
Correcting for Current
How can you tell if the course you are steering is compen-
sating fully for the current? There are several ways (Fig. 10):
• Use a range, or transit. Sight through the mark to shore. As
long as the mark remains aligned to the same spot on the
shore, you are steering the correct angle to compensate for
the current. Note that the course you steer may vary as
your boat speed changes with changing wind conditions.
• Use a bearing, back bearing, or back range. If you cannot
establish a range ahead, try a bearing to the mark ahead, a
back bearing to the mark you just rounded, or a back range
through that mark to shore. You will be able to see if you
are being pushed off your rhumb line course.
• Use the Course Over Ground (also know as Course Made
Good) function on your GPS. If you do not have any
objects to sight, then COG can give you course informa-
tion. This information is not sound until you have been on
course for some time. The averaging and sampling time
varies from brand to brand.
The current rarely pushes you either directly to windward
or leeward. Usually there is a component of the current aligned
with the course. The current may be from your weather quarter,
or leeward bow, or whatever…

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
