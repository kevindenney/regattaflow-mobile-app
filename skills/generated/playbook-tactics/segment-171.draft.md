# RegattaFlow Playbook Tactics Core Concepts

## Focus
> Part of the attraction of sailboat racing is its complexity.

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

From athletic to intellectual, from interpersonal to introspec-
tive, from reflex to endurance—we are challenged in every
way. When you have mastered all the skills, you can quit. Until
then, keep trying.
As you work to master the skills, never let the theory get
in the way of what actually works. Let the theory serve as a
starting point, not an end. Keep testing, keep working to find
what works. Then make up a theory to explain it…
Remember that this is, in the end, a sailboat race. On a
good day you may win a sailboat race. On a bad day, generally
the worst thing that will happen is you lose a sailboat race.
Finally, thank you for reading RegattaFlow Playbook. Tactics; I hope
you have enjoyed it. In parting let me wish you luck in your
racing.
