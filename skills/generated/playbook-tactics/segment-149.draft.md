# RegattaFlow Playbook Tactics Core Concepts

while others are still sorting out their options (Fig. 19).
If the right is favored, a jibe set is the quickest way to hit
that side. Just beware that on a port broad reach you must stay
clear of all boats sailing upwind. [Author’s note: As you master
the skills presented in this book, you no doubt will find that
you often round in front of your fleet. Consequently, you will
frequently be sailing back through them as you start down the
run. Such are the burdens of leadership.]
In a big fleet, use a bear-away set to a fast reaching angle
to break out of the wind shadow at the top of the leg. Once
clear of the crowd, jibe or carry on, as strategy dictates.
Attack those Ahead
Running legs give trailing boats the chance to attack
leaders. Early in the leg, you get in the attack position. Later
in the leg, you attack. Chase the boat(s) you want to attack as
they sail to the sides of the course, then attack by jibing inside
as they come back. If you try to get on their air as they sail to
the outside, you leave them an escape route. It is better to be
patient, and attack while sailing toward the middle (Fig. 20a).
