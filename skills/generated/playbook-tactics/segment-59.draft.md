## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Fig. 11 – Wind Graph and strategy for a Persistent Shift.
This Wind Graph shows a persistent shift to the left. As the
wind worked its way left it nearly ran off our graph. At 11:55
we had to reset the wind graph to re-center our numbers.
By gathering wind information before the start we were able to
form a sound race strategy to take advantage of the expected
new wind. As always, we sailed toward the next shift.
Challenge Question: Why does the wind often seem to shift
faster or more often after the start? The answer is embedded
in Chapter 10.

worse and worse. The port tack boats ended up sailing what is
known as the great circle route, getting lifted around the out-
side of the mark.
Too Far Ahead?
If the fleet goes right and you think the wind is going left,
then position yourself to the left of the fleet. Don’t split com-
pletely with the fleet, for two reasons:
First, if you split and you are right, you will end up way
ahead, and everyone will think you were just lucky. You don’t
want to win by too much; just a comfortable margin that will let
everyone see who is out front.
Second, if you split with the fleet and happen to be wrong,
you are sunk. (Somehow it is not unlucky to be half a mile
behind – you are just bad.) Hedge your bets.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
