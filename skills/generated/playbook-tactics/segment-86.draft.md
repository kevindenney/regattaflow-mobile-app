## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Fig. 6a - When one boat is ahead and the wind shifts right
boats to the right of the leader gain; boats to the left lose. If
your leverage equals your distance behind, then you gain 19%
or lose 16% in a 10° shift.

Fig. 6b - If your leverage is 5.7 times your distance behind, you
would draw even on a 10° shift in your direction. It deserves
mentioning that a 10° shift the other way would put you twice
as far behind. A bigger shift would have a bigger impact.

When One Boat is Ahead
When one boat is ahead of another, results are similar.
Consider gains and losses as a percent of distance behind, from
LEP to LEP. We will consider three cases: the boat behind
will have leverage equal to the distance behind either toward
the shift (boat 1), or away from the shift (boat 2); or will be
straight downwind, with no leverage (boat 3). When the wind
shifts 10°, the boat closer to the shift gains 19%, the boat away
from the shift loses 16%, and surprisingly, the boat straight
downwind gains slightly—about 2% (Fig 6a).
When the boats are further separated, the gains and losses
increase. We use the term leverage to describe this lateral
separation. The further apart boats are, the more leverage they
have, and the more they stand to gain or lose in a shift. A boat
which is behind will pull even with the leader in a 10° shift if
his leverage is 5.7 times the distance behind (boat 4) (and if
the shift is to his side). That may seem like a lot of separation,
but as we saw earlier, leverage builds fast when you split tacks.
In a bigger shift less leverage is needed to catch up, or to fall
twice as far behind! ( Fig. 6b).
WOW!
Through all numbers and examples, one point stands out:
wind shifts are a big deal. As I said before, the potential gains/
losses are staggering.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
