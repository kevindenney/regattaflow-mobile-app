• One option is to tack and talk. Rather than
continue, tack over and see how the other
tack feels while we assess long term strat-
egy.
• Focus on speed and tactics. Reduce risk by
consolidating with the fleet, and sail fast.
• Tack! Face it – conditions have changed, and
this is a persistent shift. Bail out now. As bad
as things seem now, it will only get worse.
• Don’t tack! Hang on. Don’t panic. The wind
will come back. The only thing more painful than
being caught on the outside of a persistent shift is
tacking, sailing headed, and then having the wind
(finally) shift back so we have to tack and sail
headed again. Not only are we in the tank, but our
old neighbors who stuck it out on the original lift
are far ahead. Aarrrgh.
There is no easy answer here, but a strategic theme
bears repeating: When unsure of what the wind will do,
then minimize the impact of shifts by minimizing leverage.
Another theme: While we sort things out, sail the tack that

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
