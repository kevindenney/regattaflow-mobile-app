tacking into a pin. The other is to tempt the rival to tack on you
(and presumably sail off in the wrong direction) while you tack
as planned (presumably going the right way). See earlier Figure
35 for Sucker Cover, but now you are the other guy!

Wave ‘em By
A port tacker who may or may not cross you can become a
real nuisance if he throws in a last second lee bow tack. If you
want to continue on starboard, wave ‘em by, even if you have
to duck a little bit. Anything to encourage him to keep going
the wrong way and stay out of your way (Fig. 44).
Ducking and Reversal
You’re on port tack, and you are approaching a star-
board-tack boat. You have five options: Cross, lee bow, cross
and tack, tack, or duck (Fig. 45). Your selection depends on
whether or not you can cross, and which way you want to go. If
you can cross, go ahead. Or lee bow, as detailed in Figure 41. If
you can cross, and you are unsure which way to go, then cross
and tack to put your opponent in a loose cover. If you can’t
cross, then tack or duck–what would you do in the absence of
the other boat? If you decide to tack, try not to tack into a pin.
Otherwise, duck.
Fig. 44 – If you are going the right way, wave a
port tacker by, even if you have to duck a little.
Fig. 45 – When in doubt, duck. 	Fig. 46 – Make a smooth turn and
carry speed as you trim up.
Take a Bearing
You can tell if you will cross by taking a bearing from
your stern to the starboard boat’s bow. If the bearing is increas-
ing, you will cross.
If there is doubt about crossing, then duck. Don’t forfeit
the race with a protest. And don’t wait for the last instant to
decide. A good smooth duck costs little. A poor duck or a crash

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
