The old adage “what goes up must come down” (or vice
versa) does not necessarily apply. In a distance race the weath-
er will change. Who knows what will be up and what will be
down tomorrow morning? All things being equal, you want to
be closer to the finish line.
To sail fast means you want to avoid sailing upwind and
downwind during a distance race. If the finish is upwind, sail
fast beat mode—foot off, never pinch—on the favored tack,
or toward the next new wind. If the course is downwind, then
tack downwind at optimum angles.
Our goal is to be the closest boat to the finish line when
the weather conditions change. By sailing a little faster on a
course slightly off the rhumb line, we can achieve that goal.
The only time we lose is if the weather never changes.
Which leads us to our next strategy modifier: The weather.
Weather Strategy
Navigators define a distance race as a race through a series
of weather changes. One of the tricks to weather strategy is to
make good use of the forecast. From my experience, one les-
son on weather strategy stands out above all else: Sail the wind,
not the forecast.
Coastal forecasting is notoriously difficult. Changes in
the weather, and the pace with which they will occur, are hard
to predict. Many distance races have been lost by boats in
perfect position for a change that arrives while the victors are
drinking champagne.
Distance racing requires an understanding of weather and
weather system movements over the duration of the race. In
order to plan long term strategy, you must have the big picture
of what the weather will do. Get all the weather information
you can, from every available source, and keep a record of the
forecasts. It is best to start tracking the weather a few days (or
weeks) before the race to get a sense of how the systems are
moving.
Tracking the forecasts for several days prior to the race
will help you see trends in the forecast. If, for example, an

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
