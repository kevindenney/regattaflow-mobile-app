## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

7.8 The Land of Opportunity
It happens, even to the best of racers. You find yourself at
the tail end of the fleet. Who knows how you got there—a third
row start, a miserable first beat, a big shift, a boat handling
disaster. I will not dwell on the ways to fall behind; at that, it
seems, we are all uniquely qualified.
The Most Important Race
So, you’re back in the pack. What should you do?
Before getting into details, recognize that in any regatta
or series your worst race is often the most important. One
astronomical score can shatter an otherwise competitive record.
The ability to bring that astronomical finish down to earth is
the mark of a champion, and success starts with attitude.
Don’t Dwell
As a skipper you should take charge. Never mind how we
got into this mess—let’s focus on getting out of it. (Besides,
more than likely it was your fault.) (Fig. 27).
Fig. 27– Sooner or later, you will fi nd yourself in “The Land of
Opportunity.”
7.7 Strategy vs. Rivals
While dealing with other boats is really a tactical issue,
other boats can enter into our strategic planning. Late in a se-
ries we may be concerned with particular boats which are close
to us in the standings.
It is good strategy to consider your close rivals, but do not
let them distract you from sailing your own boat well. There is
a danger in becoming preoccupied with the opponent. The ri-
vals are but one strategic factor. If you sail your own boat well,
the rest will fall into place. If you sail badly, then you stand a
greater chance of losing your private war.
The basic strategy when ahead is to stay between the com-
petition and the next mark (Fig. 26).
When behind the basic strategy is to split with the rival,
but not simply for the sake of splitting. If you are behind and
the rival is going the right way, splitting will leave you further
behind. You have to be patient and look for your opportunities.
