need sailing and boat handling skills, specialized sail trimming
skills, organizational skills to manage crew, and analytical
skills to grapple with information. We need to be able to set
goals and establish priorities, concentrate amidst chaos, ignore
discomfort, and learn from our mistakes.
None of us can master all the skills, and every race chal-
lenges us in new ways, for no two races are alike. Part of the
enduring appeal of racing is the breadth of the challenge it
provides.
The appeal of sailboat racing goes beyond these challeng-
es. We enjoy racing for the chance to be out on the water, for
the thrill of working with the wind, for the challenge of compe-
tition, and for the camaraderie racing brings.
1.3 The Racing Pyramid
The ingredients to racing success can be viewed in a pyra-
mid comprised of boat handling, boat speed, and tactics.
At the base of the pyramid is boat handling. You must
be able to sail your boat well before you can race well. Next is
boat speed. No matter what you race—cars, bicycles, horses,
bobsleds, whatever—speed is essential. Because sailors are not
always racing alongside their rivals, some underestimate the
importance of speed in sailboat racing.
