## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

While reaching and running starts are far less common
than upwind starts, the keys to success are familiar: Planning,
timing, and judgement are critical as always. Offwind starts
lack some of the order of upwind starts; they can be unpre-
dictable, and some of the techniques differ from those we use
upwind. Below are a few thoughts on starts in a variety of wind
angles, from straight downwind to reaches and one-legged
beats.
6.1 Running Starts
As chaotic as upwind starts are, they pale by comparison
to running starts. Starting near the ends enables you to reach
out to the side for clear air, but you are then committed to that
side for the first part of the race. Starting in the middle of the
line leaves you in bad air. Pick a side which will give you clear
air, and try to anticipate crowds and wind shadows (Fig. 1).
One of the most common mistakes in downwind starts
is delaying the spinnaker set. To hit the line at full speed you
must have your spinnaker up and drawing on your approach.
Hoist your spinnaker in stops (rubber bands or thin yarn).
Break it out and trim for full speed as early as you can—thirty
seconds to one minute before the start—to get a jump on those
who wait for the gun before hoisting. As a small boat in a
mixed fleet, this is a great time to draft on the stern wave of a
larger boat.
Sailing up the line on a starboard beam reach gives you
right of way. Expect bad air and crowds to slow your progress,
so set up early. If you approach on a broader reach timing is
trickier. Be prepared to duck boats to leeward. At the other
end, approach on starboard and then jibe after you clear the
line.

run, timing is tricky. Set
the spinnaker early and
sail fast. Control your
approach by oversteering,
but keep speed. Pick a side
to get clear air.
