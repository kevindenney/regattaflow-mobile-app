## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Fig. 6 – As the wind shifts, one
tack will be lifted up toward the
mark while the other tack will be
headed away from the mark.
With the wind shifting to the right,
(at right) starboard tack is lifted,
and port tack is headed.
A shift to the left (below) lifts port.
Tracking Conditions
In order to take advantage of wind shifts you must keep
track of them. The best way to keep track of wind shifts is to
track your close-hauled compass course. Keep a record of com-
pass headings and establish a range of highs and lows for each
tack. By recording the shifts, you can look for patterns (see Fig.
2, earlier) and anticipate upcoming shifts.
Of course, reading the compass only tells about a shift
after it has arrived. In addition to the compass, observe the
wind on the water and watch its effect on other boats. Work to
recognize and predict shifts before they arrive.

sailing distance to the windward mark.

Fig. 8b – In oscillating shifts the
wind swings back and forth
Fig. 8a – In a persistent shift the wind
shifts continuously in one direction. Oscillating Shifts
The basic strategy in an oscillating breeze is to tack with
the shifts. As the wind shifts, one tack is lifted so we can point
closer to the mark (or average wind) while the other tack is
headed further away. When the wind shifts again the advan-
tage will be reversed; whenever one tack is lifted the other is
headed. Each time we come about we are sailing toward the
next expected shift – sail to the shift. When the wind is from
the right, we sail lifted on starboard tack, toward the next shift,
which is expected from the left. When the left shift arrives
starboard tack will be headed, and port lifted. We tack again
and sail lifted on port, toward the next shift, from the right, and
so on. (Fig. 10)

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
