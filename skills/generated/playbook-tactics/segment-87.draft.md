The Message
Wind shifts are a big deal. We got that message.
Two corollaries follow:
First, if you can predict the next shift, sail to it.
Second, if you don’t know what to expect, then minimize
leverage to minimize the impact of shifts. (Have you ever been
unable to anticipate the next shift? Me neither, and the check is
in the mail.) 	(Fig. 7).
We’ll look at these two corollaries from two perspectives:
catching up when you are behind, and protecting a lead when
you are ahead.
Catching Up
When you’re unsure of the next shift, minimize lever-
age by staying in the low risk zone. Try to nibble away at the
leaders with speed while eliminating the risk due to shifts.
By minimizing leverage, you deny the leaders the chance to
stretch the lead, and you stay within striking distance. Then,
when you can predict an upcoming shift, go to it. Remember
how quickly leverage grows; you don’t need to split for long if
you’ve stayed within striking distance.
Splitting with the leaders just for the sake of splitting is
a bad risk. Since the leaders are usually going the right way
(Hint: they are in the lead), you are more likely to fall further
behind than to catch up. Stay close and wait for an opportu-
nity. Split only when the odds are in your favor. (Fig. 8).
Staying Ahead
You hear this said about champions: He gets ahead, and he
is gone. How do they do it?
About other racers you may hear: Don’t worry about him,
eventually he’ll go to pieces. Why?

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
