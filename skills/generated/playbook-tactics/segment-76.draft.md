## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

7.9 Local Knowledge
Consistent success in a local area depends on local knowl-
edge. You must learn to recognize local conditions and know
the strategy which is called for.
When I raced collegiality at Yale, our team captain, Steve
Benjamin, required us to complete a regatta report for every re-
gatta we sailed. All the regatta reports were compiled into a note-
book. Later, when I went racing on the Charles River in Boston,
for example, I could refer to dozens of reports by my teammates
covering the boats and sailing conditions I would face.
Local Knowledge: Racing in Annapolis
Each year it seems I race a regatta or two on Chesapeake
Bay, out of Annapolis. The northern bay offers a challenging
sailing venue. It is close enough to the ocean to be affected by
sea breezes, and far enough north to be battered by cold fronts
in early fall, when I seem to do most of my racing there. Winds
come from all points and in all strengths. The currents run
strong and vary widely across the bay. The winds have a big ef-
fect on the current, sometimes making a joke of the tide tables.

Disclaimer
Following are my impressions. God save you if you are
foolish enough to follow my strategic advice when you go rac-
ing on Chesapeake Bay.
South East/South Sea Breeze
Comes in on top of prevailing southerly or when no other
weather pattern is firmly in place. South East to South winds are
generally shifty but not strong. Current is important, since this
wind takes us diagonally across the bay. Beware of getting too
far in toward the Eastern Shore. The breeze tends to run lighter
and more southerly there, lifting starboard and making it painful
to tack out onto port—and easy to take the great circle route.
Against the current you must get very close to the eastern
shore to avoid the current in the main channel, and this often
leads to great circle route just described. It seems better to stay
right to avoid some current and still keep breeze. Tendency to
