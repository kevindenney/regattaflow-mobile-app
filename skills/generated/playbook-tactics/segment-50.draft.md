tions, there is often more wind at the edges of the clouds, and
less wind directly under the clouds. In a clearing northwest
wind with rows of cumulus clouds, there are usually down
drafts of stronger wind around the clouds. If you see frontal
clouds or building cumulus go to them—there is wind at the
edges, but less wind beneath them.
The Favored Side
A windward leg will often have a favored side. Boats sail-
ing to one side will have an advantage due to favorable wind,
wind shifts, or current. Sometimes it is difficult to anticipate
which side is favored. After observing the first leg we will have
a better idea for the second time around. If conditions don’t
change, then we would expect the same side to be favored
again. Also, after seeing particular conditions in a local area a
number of times, we will be able to anticipate which side will
be favored (Fig. 3).
Time Out for Terminology
Before we go on about the favored side a few details of
terminology must be cleared up: The favored side of the course
carries some strategic advantage. The favored tack takes you
to the favored side. This should not be confused with the long
tack, which is the predominant tack on a skewed beat, (i.e. a
beat where we spend more time on one tack than the other.
Often it is strategically correct to sail the long tack first – that
is, the long tack is often the favored tack. At other times the
favored tack might be the short tack (Fig. 4).
