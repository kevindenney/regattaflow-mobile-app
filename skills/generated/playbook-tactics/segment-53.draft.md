the starboard tack first, or you can tack back and forth. In the
end, you will sail X distance on starboard tack and Y distance
on port tack to get to the mark. (Fig. 5.)
When the Wind Shifts
The wind shifts, and it is good. Wind shifts allow us to
shorten the distance we sail to an upwind mark.
When the wind shifts, our close-hauled compass courses
change. With each shift one tack is lifted up above its earlier
course, and the other tack in headed below its previous course.
When one tack is lifted the other is headed, and vice versa.
(Fig. 6).
Our goal upwind is to sail each tack when it is
lifted. By sailing the lifted tack, we sail a more direct
route to our upwind destination (Fig. 7).
Sail to the Shift
The fundamental upwind strategy is to sail toward the new
wind or wind shift. As we will see, this strategy keeps us on
the lifted tack. The application of this principle changes with
different types of shifts; but the fundamental rule—sail to the
shift—never changes.
Fig. 5 – Regardless of its path, in the absence of wind shifts, each
boat will sail the same distance on port tack and the same distance
on starboard tack. The distance on each tack is fi xed. The distance
on port tack will match the distance on starboard tack only if the
mark is directly upwind. If the mark is 1 mile directly upwind then
the distance on each tack would be .71 miles for boats tacking
through 90°.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
