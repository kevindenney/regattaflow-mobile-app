shifts downwind that you use upwind. You stand to gain or lose
hundreds of yards in the shifts downwind, just as upwind.
Because it is harder to do downwind, the differences
across the fleet can be even greater than on a beat. Don’t miss
the opportunity. Get in phase by paying attention to conditions
at the end of the windward leg, search for the rare and elusive
shifts downwind, and jibe on the lifts!

Fig. 14 – When the current is pushing
across the course, it shifts the laylines. Use
a COG bearing to call the layline.
Fig. 16 – When the current is behind
you, you can jibe early and let the
current sweep you down to the mark.
Fig. 15 – When the current is against you,
it is easy to jibe too early and miss the
layline. If necessary, jibe again rather than
force a low angle against the current.
Current
Favored Side
Strong current can become the singular strategic concern.
If there was a favored side to the course on the beat, and the
advantage was current driven, then sail the opposite side on the
run. (See fig. 3b., earlier)
Uniform Current
If the current is uniform over the length of the leg, then it
will skew the course and shorten or lengthen the sailing time
on the leg. When the current is running across the course de-
termine the Course Over the Ground—COG (or Course Made
Good—CMG) by sailing past a buoy at the proper wind angle
and taking a back bearing. Use this information to determine
laylines to the leeward mark. Depending on whether you ap-
proach the mark from the up current or down current side, it is
easy to over- or under- stand the mark (Fig. 14).
When the current is against you, the biggest impact is on
the approach to the leeward mark. Boats will jibe onto what
appears to be a proper angle, only to have the current push
them up and force them to sail a lower, and slower angle in

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
