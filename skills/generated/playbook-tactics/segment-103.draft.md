## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Fig. 41 – A tack on a rival’s lee bow
necessitates a response.
Fig. 43 – When you are attacked, you can try
to keep clear air by driving off to leeward.
Fig. 42 – If the weather boat can squeeze
up, the lee bow boat will be pinned.
Defending Yourself
The defence from attack is anticipation and quick re-
sponse. In order to survive an attack, you must break through
to clear air before the attacker has reached full speed. Once the
attacker is up to speed, it is nearly impossible to break clear.
Squeeze Up to Windward
If an opponent tacks on your lee bow, you may be able to
escape by pinching up into clear air. React as soon as you are
attacked. Once you fall into the attacker’s exhaust, performance
will suffer and you will not be able escape (Fig. 42).
If the attacker’s position is strong, tack out as soon as pos-
sible, before the attack impacts your ability to tack and escape
smoothly.
Drive Through to Leeward
If a boat tacks on your air, you can either tack away im-
mediately or try to drive through to leeward to clear air. If you
anticipate the attack, you can prepare to respond. If you want
to stay on your present tack, then reach off slightly as soon as
the attacker crosses your bow. With a little extra speed and a
slightly late tack by the opponent, you may be able to break
through in front of his wind shadow (Fig. 43).
If you plan to tack away, then do so immediately. Start
your clearing tack while you still have full speed to minimize
the hurt.
Don’t Tack into a Pin
When tacking to leeward of a boat or boats, do so with
enough room to be free to tack back should the need arise.
Don’t hand a rival boat the power to decide when you will next
be free to tack.
Sucker Cover
If you are preparing to tack and see a rival coming, you
may want to delay your tack for two reasons. One is to avoid

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
