Wide-and-close turns are the best route around marks.
Practice them all the time—under sail and under power—even
in your car. You will quickly learn your boat’s appropriate
turning radius. Remember, a wide smooth turn carries speed.
It is also good to practice jamming a tight turn around a
mark— coming in close and trying to stay close by jamming
your turn. Practice accelerating out of the turn.
There are also times when you will need to slow down—such
as when you are inside but NOT entitled to room. You’ll need
to stall and let the outside (lead) boat pass. Oversteering is
the best way to do this. (For some this requires no practice.)
Another way is by over-trimming.
Time speed distance test. With your spinnaker fl ying, sail past
a mark and start a stopwatch. Go through your mark rounding
routine:. Upwind controls on, jib up, spinnaker down, and turn
upwind. How long did it take, in time and distance?
