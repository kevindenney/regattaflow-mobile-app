## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Port Tack Start
Approach the line on port tack, shoot through a gap,
and cross the fleet. This approach requires great timing and
nerves of steel.
Advantages
If the line is port end favored and the right-hand side of
the course is advantaged, a port tack start lets you blast off
toward the favored side.
Danger!
Are you Crazy? Poor timing or unsteady nerves can
lead to disaster. Other boats doing the same thing can make it
messy.
The Secret to Success
Timing, anticipation, and a bail out plan. It is always
better to duck boats – even if you duck the entire fleet – than
to slam in a last second tack. Look ahead as the fleet sets up
and pick your gap. Close reach with lots of speed and trim
into your gap. Be ready to search for a new gap on a mo-
ments notice. An adverse current can hold up the fleet and
make it easier to succeed with this approach. (It has also been
suggested that this approach be reserved for times when you
are sailing someone else's boat.)
Luffing Start
Select a spot and luff near the line. Trim for speed in the
final seconds before the gun. The object is to secure a spot on
the line.
Advantages
In a crowded fleet on a short line, this is one way to
secure a spot in the front row.
Danger!
The dangers are not leaving enough room to accelerate,
and having other boats sail over and under you before you
can respond; or being too far back and falling into bad air.
The Secret to Success
Preserve as much space as possible ahead and to lee-
ward, while preserving clear air and holding your space in the
front row. You'll need this room to accelerate.
This approach is popular in dinghies, centerboard boats
and some one-design keelboats, particularly in large fleets
where it is difficult to find room on the line. It is not practical
for any but the lightest keelboats. If your boat is relatively
light in a mixed fleet, set up to leeward of the crowd, luff
