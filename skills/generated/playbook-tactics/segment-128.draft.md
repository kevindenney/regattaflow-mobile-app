tion a boat length or two to weather. This can save you
many boat lengths and lots of hassling later. It is much
more effective than waiting to see if anyone attacks, and
then responding. Setting up early sends the message: Don’t
even think about going by, at least not on my windward
side.
On close reaches establish a clear air lane by holding high
initially so others can’t get up to you. On a broad reach it
can also work to establish weather position early, but this
can leave you vulnerable, later in the leg, to boats working
for an inside position and mark-room.
• Pay attention.
Assign one crew to keep a lookout aft. If the trailing boat
makes a move, respond promptly. An exaggerated re-
sponse will let the other boat know you are paying atten-
tion. Make a swift, sharp turn up, then slide back down
Defending Your Position
There are several techniques you can use to protect your
position and to prevent others from passing you. The correct
technique depends on the circumstances. If a group of larger
boats is rolling up from behind, it is a waste of time and effort
to try to hold them back. When a fleet of larger boats is sailing
through you, it is time to get into the get passed lane. The get
passed lane is much the same as the passing lane—a couple of
boat lengths to weather of the fleet line. The idea is to encour-
age the larger boats to sail through you to leeward, where they
won’t sail over your air (Fig. 18).
When the attacking boats are more like you in perfor-
mance, then you must choose the appropriate defense.
• Sail fast.
Sail faster than those behind you and extend your lead!

• Establish a windward position (Fig. 19).
As you start down the leg, immediately establish a posi-
