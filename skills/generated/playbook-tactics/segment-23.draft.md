Vanderbilt Start
The Vanderbilt Start is a popular but flawed approach.
The basic plan is to sail away from the line on a port tack
broad reach on the reciprocal of your starboard tack close-
hauled course. You then tack or jibe, and return to the place
from which you departed.
Advantages
The attraction of this approach is its simplicity.
Danger!
The problem? It doesn't work. At least not in a competi-
tive fleet it doesn't, as it lacks flexibility. If anything throws
off your timing, you will be late.
One flaw is that you cannot make your turn at the ap-
pointed place and time because other boats will be there. If
you somehow find room for your turn, you will lack the clear
air necessary to accelerate; and the crowds will block your
path.
The Secret to Success
In a small, uncompetitive fleet you might succeed with
this start, but you would do better to practice a technique
(like the Half Speed Approach) which will be of more use
when you move up.
If you insist on using this approach, remember that the
speeds out and back are not necessarily equal, and you must
allow sufficient time for your tack or jibe. The Vanderbilt
start was developed for big boat match racing. Congestion
and disturbed air make it a poor choice for fleet racing.
Triangle Approach
The Triangle Approach avoids
the problem of searching for room to tack or jibe in a
crowd. Initiate the triangle at the spot from which you want
to start. Sail from your starting spot on a port beam reach,
along the line and its extension. Next, jibe to a starboard
broad reach and sail down to the final approach layline. Fi-
nally, head up to close-hauled for the run at the line. Each leg
of the triangle is of about the same duration–usually 30 to 45
seconds each for a 30-foot boat, scaled up or down for larger
or smaller boats.
Advantages
The turn onto your final approach doesn't slow you
down and doesn't take much room. You are also very maneu-

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
