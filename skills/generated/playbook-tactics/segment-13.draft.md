## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

If our race strategy says go left, then a start near the left
end is called for. The advantage here is not as strong as start-
ing right to go right. More critical than the exact position is
clear air, and the freedom to continue to the left unimpeded.
If there is no clear advantage to either side, then a
midline start is indicated. There are several advantages to
a midline start. From a starting perspective, it is often the
easiest and least crowded place to start. From a race strategy
perspective, a midline start gives the greatest flexibility, as it
offers the freedom to go either way. For further discussion of
Upwind Strategy, see Chapter 7.
Simply put: Start right to go right, start left to go left,
start in the middle to keep your options open (Fig. 2).
Fig. 3 - The upwind end of the line is favored, as it is closer
in sailing distance to the windward mark.

start. When deciding where to start, consider three factors:

## Conversion Checklist
