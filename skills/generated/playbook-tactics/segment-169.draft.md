## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

12.1 The Trouble with Tactics…
The trouble with tactics is that you have to deal constantly
with factors you can’t predict or control. Strategy, which is
based on wind and weather, obviously has a high degree of
uncertainty, particularly for the narrow coastal areas in which
most of us sail. Yet the weather is relatively tame compared
to the erratic behavior of your competitors, around whom you
must base your tactics. These people are clearly irrational—af-
ter all, they choose to spend their leisure time, and considable
funds, going nowhere at 6 miles an hour!
At the same time, tactics have an enormous impact on
race results. As we have seen, hundreds of yards can be gained
(or lost) in a matter of minutes. The weather, and your ability
to predict it, has a big impact on racing success.
By comparison, boat handling and boat speed are quite
pedestrian. Performance differences are measured in tenths of
a knot. A better tack may save you half a boat length. While a
wind shift may bring a huge gain (or loss) in a matter of mo-
ments, gains from boat speed accrue slowly, over time.
The upside of boat speed and boat handling is that they
are completely within your control. You don’t need to rely on
any outside factors, or predict the unpredictable. Your boat
handling and boat speed can be good every day.
In the performance pyramid, boat handling is the base.
You won’t be able to race successfully until you can sail well:
get sails up and down, tack and jibe, accelerate, and maneuver
without hesitation. Your boat handling must be second nature,
so you can pick your head up, look around, and do tactics.
Boat speed is the next building block. If you are fast,
you’ll soon find you are clever tactically. If you are slow, then

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
