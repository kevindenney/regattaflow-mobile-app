layline here, unlike when you are against the current. Also,
warn your crew. The mark will sneak up on you before you
expect it. Get the jib ready early (Fig. 16).
Non-Uniform Current
When the current is crossing the course and it is stronger
in the beginning or end of the leg, your current strategy is to
minimize the distance sailed through the water. As you might
have guessed, you should seek a position where you can let the
current help you when it is strongest.
If the current will be stronger later in the leg, then posi-
tion yourself up current while the current is weak and let the
current sweep you down to the mark. In doing this you will get
the added benefit of a sailing wind header during the current
portion of the leg. If you sail to the down current side initially,
then you will end up fighting the current later on. Your troubles
would be compounded by a less favorable wind angle as well
(Fig. 17).
If the current is stronger early, don’t fight it. Let it sweep
you down and correct for it later. Sail the jibe which is headed
by the current until you run out of current, and sail the other
jibe later (Fig. 18).
Fig. 18 – When the current is stronger early in the leg don’t
fi ght it. Sail the jibe which is headed by the current to get out of
it most quickly.
Fig. 17 – If you know the current will be stronger later in
the leg, set up on the up current side of the course while the
current is weak so you will have the current on your stern when
it is strongest..

< Fig. 19 – As you fi nish the beat, plan your
rounding. Which way do you want to go? An
immediate move to the favored side will give
you a jump on the competition but beware
of jibing into the traffi c and bad air of boats
coming upwind.
