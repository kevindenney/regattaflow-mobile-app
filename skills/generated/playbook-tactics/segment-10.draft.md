Race Info
In this section, list critical race details. It will save you the
embarrassment of digging for the Race Book or Sailing Instruc-
tions as you watch everyone in your class start five minutes
early…
Course Info
List the distance and compass heading for each leg of the
course along with which sails you anticipate using.
Starting Line
Use this to plot the set up of the starting line, and by com-
paring that to the wind direction, you can determine which is
the upwind (favored) end of the line. In the example shown, the
right end of the line is 10° favored.
Weather Forecast
Essential meteorological data should be recorded here,
along with the marine forecast. This often provides an amusing
juxtaposition to the actual, observed weather.
The Back of the Planner
The back of the race planner should be used for post-race
comments. Immediately after the finish, review the race leg by
leg. Go over trim, tactics, and crew work; record new ideas.
List any equipment problems (and think through any excuses
you may need to explain away the race back at the bar). Con-
firm the schedule for the next practice (you do practice, don’t
you?) and race. Also print a diagram of your local race area on
the back of your race planner. The chart can then be used after

## Conversion Checklist

- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
