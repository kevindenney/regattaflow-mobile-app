2.3 The Race Planner
A standardized form, or Race Planner, can help you or-
ganize race information, and make sure you don’t forget any
details. A completed form is shown here. A sample blank is
shown on the following page. Copy it, refine it, and send me
ideas. You could be made famous in the next edition!
The form is divided into sections.
The Wind Graph
The purpose of the wind graph is to track the true wind
direction over time. We do this not by luffing into the wind, but
by recording our close-hauled compass course on each tack,
and then averaging those numbers. For example, if our close-
hauled course on starboard is 160°, while on port we sail 250°,
then the wind direction is 205°. (In this example we are tack-
ing through 90°, so on each tack we are sailing 45° off the true
wind.)
Note: There are several reasons to work from close-hauled
compass numbers rather then luffing into irons. For one, it al-
lows us to tune up in race trim while at the same time gathering
wind info. Second, luffing into irons beats up your sails; don’t
do it! Third, recent studies have shown that once the race starts,
luffing into irons is “tactically disadvantageous.” Since we’ll
be working from close-hauled compass numbers during the
race, we might as well get used to using close-hauled numbers
while we tune up.
How to Use It
During the hour prior to the start, and during the race,
we’ll record the time, wind speed, boat speed, and close-hauled
compass course. Record starboard tack numbers under the
Stbd heading, and port tack numbers under the Port heading.
We’ll then average those numbers to get the wind direction.
Here’s the Trick
After recording the initial starboard number, if the next
starboard number is to the right (higher) then record it on the
next line, shifted to the right. If the next starboard number is to
the left, then offset it to the left. Same for port, and ultimately,

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
