11.3 Mark Rounding Rules and Tactics
Mark roundings on reaches and runs have a set of rules
and tactics which are distinct from windward mark roundings.
Rounding Alone
In wide, out close.
When rounding an offwind mark alone, complete the turn
and be on course for the next leg as you pass the mark. The
wide turning radius necessary to hold speed through the round-
ing requires that you start wide of the mark in order to finish
close. Practice wide-and-close roundings wherever you are,
under sail or power, to improve your feel for your boat’s han-
dling characteristics. You’ll find you need a two boat length
radius to carry speed well through a turn (Fig. 3).
Fig. 3 – When rounding alone, use a smooth turn
to carry speed. Come in wide and go out close for
best position, as the checkered boat is doing.
Fig. 2 – The Checkered boat has right
of way over the trailing boat as a boat
clear ahead, and over the lead boat by
starboard/port.
L
W
Fig. 1b – A leeward boat which
establishes an overlap from astern shall
not sail above her proper course.
(Rule 10). Just as upwind, you are better off to take a starboard
boat’s stern than to risk a foul—or be forced into a sudden jibe.
Note also that the port starboard rule applies even when com-
ing from behind on a run. The clear astern rule applies only to
boats on the same tack (Fig. 2).

The wide-and-close rounding carries speed through the
turn and places you to windward with clear air and freedom
to maneuver. Proper roundings save boat lengths. A proper
rounding at a leeward mark lets your carry reaching speed up
to a close-hauled course. A proper rounding at a jibe mark
protects your air if the next leg is broad, and gives a little extra
height when struggling on a close reach.
Although this section is short, its importance cannot be
overstated. Usually you round alone. Proper roundings can
save half a minute or more on a six-legged course.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
