## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Persistent Shifts
The strategy in a persistent shift is to sail toward the new
wind. If the wind is shifting to the right, then go right. If the
wind is shifting left, go left.
Sail Headed
In a persistent shift, one tack is continuously getting
headed while the other is getting lifted. Our strategy is to first
sail the tack which is getting headed, then sail the tack which is
getting lifted. Why? The tack which is getting headed is getting
worse all the time. It is headed now, but will be headed more
later. Sail it now before it gets worse. The tack which is get-
ting lifted is improving all the time. If we sail it now we will be
missing a better lift later.
Are you Sure it’s a Persistent Shift?
How hard is it to split with the fleet and sail into a header?
Without our pre-race info, weather forecast, and/or observation
of other boats on which to build our strategy, it would be crazy.
Even with good information and a well thought out plan, it is
hard to stick to your guns as the fleet tacks away. If you know
what is coming, then go to it. Position yourself to the favored
side of the fleet.
The Rewards
How much do you gain by sailing into a persistent shift? It
depends how far the wind shifts and how far you are separated
from your competition; but in a word – plenty.
