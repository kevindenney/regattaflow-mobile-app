# RegattaFlow Playbook Tactics Core Concepts

## Focus
> Strategy in Brief: Be Near the Shift

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

When the wind shifts, the ladder rotates. A boat closer to
the new wind gains—he is on a higher rung, and boats further
from the shift end up on a lower rung. The closer to the shift
you are, the further you are up the ladder and the less distance
you have to sail to get to the mark. Sail to the next shift.
Where have I heard that before? (Fig. 2b).
How Much do you Gain (or Lose) in a Shift?
The distances are staggering. When the wind shifts 10° the
boat closer to the shift gains 25% of the lateral distance sepa-
rating the boats.* For boats on the same LEP, and separated by
100 yards the gain is 25 yards. For boats separated by a greater
distance the gains/losses are greater** (Fig. 3).
For example, if two boats are separated by 848 feet the
gain/loss would be 212 feet. 848 feet of separation may seem
like a lot but consider……

Fig. 4 - After one minute of sailing time at six knots, boats are
separated by 848 feet. 212 feet will be gained or lost in a 10°
shift. It takes 21 seconds to sail 212 feet at six knots.

……How Quickly it Happens
Imagine two boats sailing close hauled at a boat speed of
6 knots and tacking through 90°. They cross tacks, with the
port boat ducking. Each boat sails for one minute—you know,
sixty seconds. After one minute of sailing time, they will be
848 feet apart. A 10° shift will put one boat 212 feet ahead. At
six knots, that distance represents 21 seconds of sailing time.
Separating for 60 seconds creates a 20+ second gain/loss. Your
risk/reward on a 10° shift is one-third the time you spend split-
ting tacks with another boat (Fig. 4).
So, we were caught to the right when the wind shifted 10°
left. What should we do? And what about the boat that went

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
