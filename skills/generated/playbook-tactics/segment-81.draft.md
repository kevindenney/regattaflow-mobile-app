Newport Rhode Island Strategy Quiz:
See the Chart at Right
We are part of a crew racing in Newport, just outside
the harbor, adjacent to Goat Island. The course is Windward
Leeward — 5 legs. We are getting ready to race. Our skip-
per wants to know what our strategy should be; which way
should we go?
Looking upwind here is what we see:
The sea breeze is blowing steadily across the course,
about 15 knots true, and very steady everywhere.
On the right hand side of the course there are waves
rolling in with the sea breeze. To the left, under the headland,
smooth water, but the same wind; strong and steady.
Which way should we go?
Upwind: Against the waves to the right,
or in the smooth water to the left? _____________.
Downwind: With the waves,
or in the smooth water?_____________.
