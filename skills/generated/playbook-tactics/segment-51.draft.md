commitment would make it difficult to recover. Second, as we
shall see, there are strategic and tactical reasons to avoid the
corners, since they can leave us out of position and with few
options. We would only sail to the extreme sides if:
• We are confident about our strategy and
• We must go to the extreme to get the advantage.
Caught on the Wrong Side: Now What?
What should you do if you sail to the favored side, get half
way up the beat, and realize it is not the favored side after all?
That is a tough question. Often it is surprising how close you
end up to the leaders if you bail out half way up the leg and cut
your losses. On the other hand, the ultimate frustration is bail-
ing out early and then seeing those who stuck with it come out
ahead in the end. Curses.
Of course, never having made such a mistake myself, it is
hard to offer insights. I can offer a few ideas based purely on
the experience of others:
• Don’t overcommit to begin with—play the middle. (Now
you tell me!)
• Hedge your bets. When in doubt stay with the pack.
• Be realistic about how things are going; don’t kid yourself.
• While you ponder what to do sail toward the middle, not
further into the corner.
Which Side is Favored?
How can you tell which side is favored before the race?
Here are some ways:
• Your own experience. Local knowledge can help you
guess the favored side based on past experience in simi-
lar weather.
• Testing. Sail to the sides of the course prior to the start.
Is there better breeze, or a consistent shift to one side?
Even if you can’t sail up the beat you can test wind
strength by reaching out off the extension of the line for
a couple of minutes.
• More testing. Test with a tuning partner. Each boat sails
to one side for a prescribed amount of time – say 3 min-
utes – and then tacks back. Who’s ahead?
