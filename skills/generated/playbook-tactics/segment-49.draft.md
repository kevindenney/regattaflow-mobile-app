more variable the wind and current, the more important strat-
egy will be to our success. In stable conditions boat speed will
be the dominant concern. Our focus depends on what we see as
the key to success in today’s conditions.

7.3 Wind
Wind Strength
Find more wind. Sail in stronger wind more of the time
and you can’t lose. There are several things to look for to find
more wind.
Look for wind on the water. Stand up in your boat and
look upwind. Puffs create dark patches on the water. It is
tricky to distinguish shadows, changes in bottom color, and dif-
ferences due to sunlight; but the wind is there if you can pick it
out.
The wind changes near shore. Most of our racing is done
close enough to shore that winds vary across the course. Often
there is better wind near shore. When the wind is blowing on-
shore the thermals near shore create more wind. In an offshore
wind the thermal mixing near shore sometimes pushes the
stronger winds from aloft down to the surface. At other times
the wind is lighter near shore. By paying attention and keeping
records, you will be able to anticipate the change in wind as
you get near shore.
Clouds often bring more wind. In partly cloudy condi-

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
