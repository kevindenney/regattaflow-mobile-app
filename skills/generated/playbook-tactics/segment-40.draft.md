this all-important starting skill.
Don’t be late
If you are habitually late for starts, build in an extra fi ve or ten
seconds into the sequence. That is, plan to start fi ve seconds
early. It is much easier to waste time than it is to retrieve time
that is lost when you are late. (You’ve noticed that too, I bet.)
Rotate Positions
During practice, rotate crew positions to get an idea of what
each crew member is doing. How hard is it to grind in the jib?
How tricky is it to call the line (much less stay on board) when
working the point on a wavy day?
Watch Other Starts
Try a position off the pin end to see how other fl eets sag and
accelerate. Try watching from behind the line to see how others
approach and create room to accelerate. Rather than try to
watch the entire fl eet, focus your attention on one or two boats
for the last minute or two of the sequence.
Practice Partner
Adding just one more boat can make all the difference. Set a
short (2 length) line and practice starts.
