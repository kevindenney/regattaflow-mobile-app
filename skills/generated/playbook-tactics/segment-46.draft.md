breeze first and roll over you before you get it. From the lee-
ward position you have right of way. A good start is essen-
tial. If you fall into bad air, you risk being rolled by one boat
after another.
As a small boat in a mixed fleet, the leeward position
may not work out, as you’ll get rolled by faster boats. In hull
speed conditions there is an opportunity to hitch a ride on the
quarter wave or stern wave of a larger boat by dropping in
from close to windward (Fig. 2).
Wind Aft of the Beam
With the wind abaft the beam and the rhumb line per-
pendicular starting line, clear air is available only at the
weather end, and everyone knows it. Reaching up the line
will give you luffing rights on those reaching into the line
from above, but no wind.
Don’t be surprised if the entire fleet does not respond to
your hail to clear out as you charge up the line. In a crowd
boats are insulated by their neighbors, and often there is no
way to respond. Boats with right-of-way and no air are often
bowled over by the mass of boats reaching in.
A start which gets your nose out in front of the crowd
and into clear air can mean winning the race. Here again
there is an opportunity for small boats to draft in the stern
wave of larger boats (Fig. 3).

end. The battle there can
be unruly, with right-of-
way boats bowled over
by the sheer mass of
intruders.
Fig. 2 - On a reach when the wind is forward of the beam, a start at
the leeward end of the line gives the best sailing angle. An on time,
full speed start is essential. There is a danger of getting rolled by one
boat after another if you fall into bad air. In a mixed fl eet, there are

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
