# RegattaFlow Playbook Tactics Core Concepts

## Focus
> 12. Getting Off the Line

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

The starting signal marks the midpoint of the start. We've
dashed down the runway—now for the climb out. The final
seconds before the start, and the two minutes after, are often a
pure sprint for clear air. Speed is the key ingredient. A little ex-
tra speed or pointing here translates into a big advantage. Make
sure you are tuned up before the start; concentrate on sailing
your boat; ignore others. Try to start faster than full speed if
possible, and blast off. Settle the crew and concentrate on steer-
ing and trim.
The tactician should watch the compass and the fleet for
shifts and room to tack. Being a shade slow or a little low even-
tually leads to bad air, and problems multiply. Keep clear air
and keep moving. Nothing else matters (Fig. 15).
Fig. 13 - Call the line accurately to avoid midline sag.
We're over the line!
We're behind the line!
We're on the line!
Fig. 14 - You should always know your time to the line.
With practice you will be able to make accurate calls.
Fig. 15 - At the gun blast off the line and Sail Fast. Only those
with speed will be free to pursue strategy unimpeded. Others
will have to compromise strategy to keep clear air.
