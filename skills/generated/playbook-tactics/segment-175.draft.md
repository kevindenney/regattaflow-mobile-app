## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

long as she gives the keep clear boat room to do so.
board, when one tacks to port she is not afforded any room or
time, as she created her own burden (Fig. 6b).
Rule 16: Changing Course
“16.1 When a right-of-way boat changes course, she shall
give the other boat room to keep clear.” As with Rule 15, Rule
16.1 (and 16.2, which further constrains a starboard boat when
a port-tack boat is ducking) provides the keep clear boat with
time to adjust to changing circumstances. The most common
situation where this rule comes into play is when leeward boat
luffs a windward boat. With a substantial overlap the leeward
boat can luff aggressively and the windward boat must re-
spond. With a small overlap of Leeward’s bow to Windward’s
stern, Leeward must allow room for Windward’s stern to swing
down as Windward responds to Leeward’s attack (Fig. 7).
Rule 17: On the Same Tack; Proper Course
This one can be a bit confusing: If a leeward boat got
her overlap from clear astern she is not allowed to sail above
proper course. Note that this does not change the right of way
– the windward boat must still keep clear – it just constrains the
leeward boat to a course no higher than the course she would
sail if the windward boat were not there (Fig. 8).
What’s the rationale? I’m not sure; but here’s one thought:
If an overtaking boat tries passing to windward the leeward
boat can head up to defend her air; whereas if the overtaking
boat passes to leeward she is not allowed to luff. In the first
case the boat is allowed to defend her air – a defensive posture.
Whereas an overtaking boat is not allowed to attack. The rules
are set up as a shield: you can defend; but not as a sword: you
are not meant to attack with protection from the rules.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
