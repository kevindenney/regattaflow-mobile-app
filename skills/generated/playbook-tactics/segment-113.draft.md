## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

are beaming. We’ve hit the big one. More big gains while
some out-of-phase rivals sail off headed.
More lift, and the first hints of paranoid fear infect our
glee. The big lift holds, and we start to wonder if it will ever
go back. A slight header, and we start to think about tacking,
even though we are still lifted compared to average for the day,
but before we can act the big lift returns.
Genuine concern now. Have conditions changed? Are we
now on the outside of a persistent shift – sailing away from the
shift on the Great Circle Route? Or will the oscillations return?
What should we do? Tack and take our medicine? Hang on
and look for at least a bit of a header to go back on? (Fig. 60).
I wish I had the answer for this one. The best I can offer
are ideas:
• Look ahead, and look at the sky. Have things heated
up? Clouds moved in or out? Any clues from boats
further upwind, or to the sides?
• Review the forecast. What did we expect?
• Where’s the fleet? Our risk is measured in leverage. If
our rivals are going our way, then the risk is small. If
they’ve split, then the risk is great. If they are going
both ways...
Rules, Ethics, and Self Interest
The rules upwind are straightforward, much more so
than at starts or offwind marks. Protests are usually the result
of greed or surprise which cloud your judgment. Don’t get
greedy—be ready to duck if you can’t cross cleanly, and look
ahead to avoid surprises.
And when you foul someone, acknowledge the foul and
take your penalty.
When you have the right of way, you need not protest ev-
ery offense. You can protest a close port/ starboard; but you can
also hail the offender, “You owe me one.” In the long run, your
own interests will be better served if you don’t protest unless
your performance suffers. If you protest even when the port
boat might have made it, you will probably win the protest. He
