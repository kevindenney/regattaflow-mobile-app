More on Learning the Rules
If you race sailboats in the United States, you should be a
member of the United States Sailing Association. As a member
you’ll be supporting the group that oversees the sport, admin-
isters the rules, and provides guidelines and training for race
manager, judges, measurers and umpires. Join.
US Sailing also offers a handy Quick Guide to help you
learn the rules. It really is handy.

Dellenbaugh’s DVD Learn the Racing Rules. If you want to
study the rules, get the book and DVD. These are the two best

of the rules part of your learning; but don’t let the rules stop
you from racing.
