3.1 Introduction: Elements of Strategy
The start of a sailboat race is one of the most exciting
and demanding moments in sports. Starts require judgement,
timing, and teamwork. They require an understanding of
wind and weather, and knowledge of strategy, tactics, and
rules. Starts demand dexterity at close-quartered maneuver-
ing. Finally, starts require the ability to stay cool and con-
centrate in an environment packed with distractions. These
requirements create a uniquely thrilling, and at times baffling,
challenge.
Given so many areas of concern, our success will de-
pend on our ability to prioritize—to determine which factors
are critical to a particular start. The goal is to hit the starting
line at the gun at the favored end, with speed and clear air,
and freedom to maneuver at will.
The starting signal is but the midpoint of the start. A
good start is one which finds us in the front row, free and
clear, not just at the gun, but a or two minute later, after the
sprint off the line.
To succeed we must create order from the chaos of the
starting line. First we need a Starting Strategy—a game plan
based on the information gathered during our race prepara-
tion. Once we have a plan, then starting tactics will be used
to implement the plan. This chapter will look at starting
