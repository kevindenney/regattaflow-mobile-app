## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

First, the shoreline funnels the wind. The wind shifts to follow
the shoreline. Second, offshore winds tend to shift more per-
pendicular to the shoreline (Fig. 14). Third, winds shift around
obstacles such as hills, buildings, and thermal domes in areas
with lots of pavement (Fig. 15).
Fourth, the heating of the land creates thermal winds—sea
breezes—which blow towards shore during the day.
Fifth, the thermals create turbulence and mixing which
can pull the upper winds down to the surface. These upper
Fig. 14 – Offshore winds tend to shift
more perpendicular to the shoreline. 	Fig. 15 – A city or hill can create oscillating
shifts, with bigger shifts near shore. 	Fig. 16 – As the land heats up, you
get a persistent shift as the prevailing
wind shifts to the sea breeze direction.
