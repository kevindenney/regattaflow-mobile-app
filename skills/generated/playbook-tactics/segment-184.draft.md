## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

early forecast predicts a front 24 hours into the race, and a
more recent forecast suggests the front will arrive 36 hours into
the race, then you can guess that the weather system movement
is slowing (and perhaps the front will never arrive).
During the race update your forecast with weather radio,
your own observations (is the barometer changing as fore-
cast?), and via the Internet. If you can set your boat up to have
web access during a distance race, then you can get weather
data and forecasts from NOAA and other public sites.
One skill you need is the ability to interpret forecasts and
apply them to your specific area. During the race, tracking
reported conditions in the area will help you distill the forecast.
By tracking reported conditions you can chart the advance of
changing weather, judge its pace, and predict its impact on your
specific area.
Your basic strategy should remain a race to the finish, in
the existing conditions, until you can confidently predict what
will happen to the weather, and when. Only then should you
modify your strategy to suit the predicted weather.
When you are confident of the forecast what should you
do? As conditions change you want to be 1) the boat closest to
the finish 2) the boat closest to the new wind.
Here’s an example: Day two the 1987 Annapolis to New-
port race. We’re in the midst of a glorious spinnaker surf, roar-
ing along on starboard jibe in 20-25 knots of wind, somewhere
off the Jersey shore. The weather radio is forecasting contin-
ued southerlies and sweltering conditions.
Thomas Dolby is raging from the Rick’s boom box: We’ll
be the Pirate Twins Again. The tape ends and auto ejects.
WCBS News Radio 88 AM takes over from New York. We are
still out of range of the New York NOAA station, but WCBS
forecasts relief from the heat wave, and north winds by sunset.

“Beautiful sleeping weather” the weatherman raves, “A break
from the heat.”
Hearing this forecast, we split jibes to the north and meet

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
