Fig. 23 – Sailing into the corners presents
the same hazards downwind as upwind. Once
you are in the corner, you lose your strategic
fl exibility and you are subject to attack with
no way to escape.
Fig. 24 – If the leg is skewed so
one tack is longer than the other,
try to sail the long tack fi rst. The
short tack will lead you quickly to a
corner, and the hazards found there.
Of course, as difficult as it may be to sail the middle, it
is recommended. Sail to the corners only when there is a clear
and definite strategic advantage. As with upwind sailing, it is
usually best to…
… Avoid the Corners
As upwind, the corner leaves us strategically spent, un-
able to take advantage of changing winds, vulnerable to attack,
and devoid of tactical options (Fig. 23).
The corners are easy to reach if the run is skewed—so that
you will spend substantially more time on one tack than the
other. It is generally best to sail the long tack first—just as we
do upwind. The danger in sailing the short tack first is that we
quickly may find ourselves in the corner (Fig. 24).
Of course, if the run is so heavily skewed that no jibe will
be required, then it is no longer a run but a reach, and reaching

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
