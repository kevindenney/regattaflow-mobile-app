Stay With the Fleet
When you are ahead, stay with those behind you. No sur-
prise here. Sail the same breeze as those around you; just sail

Cover When Ahead
Stay between the fleet and the next shift. If you are ahead
and can anticipate the next shift, sail to it. If you are ahead, you
have to hit the shifts to stay ahead. Your lead won’t last long if
you follow the fleet into the shifts (Fig. 16).
Stay between the fleet and the next mark. If you can’t find
the next shift, find the mark and protect your position that way.
Lead the fleet toward the mark or shift.
Sometimes you can’t cover. There are times when it sim-
ply does not pay to cover. When conditions become dramatical-
ly shifty, the impulse is to cover tightly. But in these conditions
it can prove impossible to cover an opponent. Concentrate on
sailing your own race. Try to keep your cool when things get
weird.
One-Legged Beats
When the course is skewed by a major wind shift so you
can nearly fetch the windward mark, you are sailing a one-
legged beat. Tactically, the best position is ahead and to lee-
Lead the Crowd
As you approach a crowd of boats, tack ahead and to
leeward, rather than sail through the crowd to their hip. There
are a number of reasons why this works. First, it is best to stay
with the fleet, as mentioned above. Second, if the crowd is
sailing toward the next shift, then you will be the first to get it.
Third, once you sail into a crowd you may have trouble finding
clear air or a tacking lane. Fourth, if you decide you want to get
across to the outside, you can tack again and exercise that op-

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
