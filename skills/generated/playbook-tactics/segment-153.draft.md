## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Sometimes the course to the mark is on the cusp between
carrying wing and wing and sailing a jib reach. If you will have
to sail part of the leg running wing and wing, and part broad
reaching with the jib to leeward, then you can use standard
strategic criteria to decide when to reach and when to run.
Wind strategy calls for running off in puffs, and reaching up
in lulls. Current positioning is more critical than with spinna-
kers as boats are relatively slower. In shifts, try a direct course,
altering trim as winds oscillate. You will experience more shifts
than under spinnaker, as you will not be running away from
them as fast, but you will still experience fewer shifts down-
wind than upwind.
A run which is sailed entirely on starboard resembles an
outside reach, while a port tack run resembles an inside reach,
as described in the previous chapter.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
