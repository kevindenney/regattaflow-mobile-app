minutes after the start. You (with any luck) will no longer
be in the start area – you will be racing upwind, and meet
the shift part way. Sailing at about six knots of boat speed*
your upwind speed (Velocity Made Good, VMG) is about
four knots. You are sailing toward the wind shifts and the
closing speed is fourteen knots (10 knots of wind speed plus
4 knots VMG). The frequency of shifts for boats racing up-
wind increases to a shift every 4 minutes, 18 seconds.
As you turn downwind, you sail away from the shifts.
Instead of meeting them half way as you were upwind, you
are now running away from the shifts. With a VMG down-
wind of about four knots, the closing speed of the shifts is
reduced to six knots. (10 knots of wind speed less 4 knots
VMG.) Downwind, you experience shifts once every 10 min-
utes, or less than half the frequency of the shifts experienced
upwind (Fig. 10a, c).
The ratio of wind shifts experienced upwind and down-
wind changes with the wind speed and boat performance – but
not very much. In lighter air or with faster boats the differ-
ences are exaggerated to the point where the fleet experiences

Fig. 10a – In a 10-knot wind with shifts spaced 1 mile apart,
the Race Committee, at anchor, experiences a shift every 6
minutes. Boats racing upwind experience shifts every 4 min 17
sec, while boats sailing downwind only experience a shift once
every 10 minutes! You will experience more than twice as many
shifts upwind as downwind.
Fig. 10b – In fact, there will be times when you experience
oscillating shifts upwind and one persistent shift on the
downwind leg.
*The boat speeds and VMG’s used here are approximations for a 30-35 foot
boat. Yours may vary.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
