## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

clock also favors the right.
With an outbound current, sail to the main channel to get
to the current but stay right once in the current. Avoid the left
corner.
South/South West Sea Breeze
The sea breeze will fill and reinforce a South to South
West wind. As the breeze builds, it does not back to the south
as might be expected (since ocean lies to S.E.). Winds around
200°—210° roll straight up the bay. Winds tend to clock, and
lift inshore between Tolly Point and Thomas Point.
Against the flood, the best tactic is to tack inside the line
between Tolly and Thomas (don’t forget to honor Tolly Pt.
Buoy) to avoid the current. With the wind tending right, all
signs lead inshore.
On the ebb, a more moderate strategy is called for; but
the channel is often out of reach to the left, and there is rarely
a strong ebb current against a southerly wind. The wind effec-
tively blocks the current, and wind strategy prevails.
Westerlies
The prevailing westerlies can become blustery after a
frontal passage. Most cold fronts take the wind N.W. or N., but
a post-frontal westerly is not uncommon. The races are gener-
ally started near the Eastern Shore, with the windward mark set
at the mouth of the Severn River. The wind tends to fan out of
the Severn, particularly in the upper half of the beat. Boats sail-
ing out to either side are lifted. They never get a favorable shift
for a return tack, and boats come back from the corners headed.
The wind also gets lighter off to the sides. Work the middle
for the steadiest and strongest winds coming straight out of the
Severn.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
