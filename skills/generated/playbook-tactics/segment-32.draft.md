# RegattaFlow Playbook Tactics Core Concepts

## Focus
> 8. To Defend your Space

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Once you are set up with a space to leeward, you may
have to defend it from those who would steal it away. This may
happen while you are killing time, luffing, before you make
your final mad dash to the line. Suppose you see a port tack
boat sailing down the line, eyeing your space; or you see a star-
board tacker ducking sterns, looking for a space to cut in. How
can you defend you position? With sails luffing, turn your bow
down and stretch your boat across your space. Unless the space
is huge (big enough for two), this should scare off the treasure
hunters. The port-tack boat should continue down the line;
while the starboard tacker may take the space to windward,
rather than leeward. Once the threat has passed, trim the main
hard and put the helm over to bring your bow up. You may let
your neighbor to windward off the hook with this move, but
you should be able to save your space (Fig. 11a,b).
If you have already started to build speed on your final
dash, then don't worry about others sailing into your space. The
port tacker won't be able to tack and accelerate into your spot
before you drive over him, and the starboard boat won't be able
to drive through you far enough to be a threat. As you trim up,
you will gas him.
Another way you can protect your territory is with sweep-
ing turns up and down. This is an effective way to kill time and
preserve your space.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
