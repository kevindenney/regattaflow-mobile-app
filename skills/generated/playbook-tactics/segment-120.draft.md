hold speed, and to reach the next puff sooner. We all tend to
sail down to—but not below—the rhumb line in puffs, and
above it in lulls. This is both to protect clear air, and because
it feels fast to reach up a little higher. Trouble is, it leaves you
above the rhumb line and forces you to reach off later. Avoid
this if you can. Sail below the rhumb line in puffs, so you can
preserve your fast reaching angle later in the leg (Fig. 2).
Off in puffs, up in the lulls is sound reaching strategy. It is
not always true on runs, as we will see in the next chapter.
Building Breeze / Fading Breeze
Don’t wait for a building breeze to come to you—go up
and get it. Think of a building breeze as one long lull followed
by one long puff. Go up in the lull and off in the puff to get the
best overall performance. You make big gains by aggressively
pursuing a new wind. Be bold (Fig. 3).
In a fading breeze, the same strategy applies in reverse.
The existing wind is a relative puff—sail low in it and reach up
as the breeze fades (Fig. 4). This is a difficult strategy to pursue
as tactical considerations often overwhelm it. Sailing low
invites those behind to sail over you and to steal what wind you
have. If you can hold low and keep clear air, your dividends
will be big. Reaching up in the lighter air will give you a real
boost. It will also push your apparent wind angle forward so
your air will be more difficult to steal.
Wind Shifts
Oscillating Wind Shifts
Oscillating conditions will often feel like puff and lull
conditions and should be treated that way. As the wind shifts
aft (a lift), the apparent wind will decrease. Head up to main-
tain apparent wind strength and boat speed. Similarly, as the

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
