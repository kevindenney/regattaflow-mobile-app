verable as you reach in. The triangle approach allows more
room to accelerate than other approaches and provides flex-
ible timing in variable conditions. Recommended for light to
moderate air. Works anywhere on the line.
Danger!
Don't be late. If you are late, you may not have time to
get through the crowd and around the bargers.
The Secret to Success
If you fear you are running late on leg two, cut the cor-
ner. Often legs two and three turn into one long continuous
sweeping turn.

Port Tack Approach for a Pin End Start
From the starting pin, sail up the line on port tack,
toward the fleet. As you near the pack of starboard tack boats
working down the line, tack to leeward of the crowd and lead
them back toward the pin.
Advantages
A port tack approach allows you to set up late and is the
easiest way to judge the timing for a pin end start.
Danger!
Where do we begin? There are the obvious port-star-
board and tacking-too-close risks, the risk of not finding a
space to tack into, and the need to tack and accelerate late in
the sequence. This can be particularly difficult in light air.
The Secret to Success
This is an excellent set up for a pin end start. Note the
time as you sail past the pin, and keep track of the split time
as you sail up the line. It may be necessary to duck some
early starboard tackers and then jump into the next gap.
Obviously, good crew work is essential to a smooth tack and
quick acceleration. Your approach should set up three to four
boat lengths from the line. Also, to carry speed into the tack,
head up and trim on port before tacking to starboard.
Port Tack Approach for a Midline Start
As with the pin end start, come in from the left end of
the line about three boat lengths below the line. As you near
the pack of starboard tack boats, duck the early bunches and

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
