tage. From there the race is often a sprint to the left in search of
puffs from the Severn. The puffs are starboard headers, allow-
ing a tack to port and a lifted track into the mark.
North Wind
In a northerly there is no fixed strategy. With the mark set
below the bridge there may be some port lifts off Whitehall,
but there may also be better breeze in the open part of the bay.
If the wind is clocking then plan a strategy to take advantage of
the persistent shift. Current can become a big factor. Stay left
to avoid an ebb. Go right to take advantage of a flood, though
the wind may diminish its strength.
Northeast Wind
As the frontal wind fades the breeze will clock to the
northeast. The temptation is to go right, and that strategy may
pay off early in the leg. But if the mark is set under the Eastern
Shore the right will be a problem later on. In the second half
of the beat boats coming in on port from the left hand side will
be favored by more northerly puffs which roll down from the
bridge, while those on the right suffer in fickle easterly puffs
off the shore and big northerly headers.
The current can be a big factor, as you will have to cross
the main channel on the way to the mark. After a strong north-
erly there will be little water left for an ebb, but beware the
flood which may run longer and much stronger than usual as
the bay refills.
Easterly Wind
The easterlies are among the most fickle and difficult of
bay breezes. One thing is for sure. Rain is on the way. Stay
home, stay dry; put in the storm windows until the rain starts,
then watch football on TV. Have you noticed that the Redskins
have been lousy since they closed Marmaduke’s?
