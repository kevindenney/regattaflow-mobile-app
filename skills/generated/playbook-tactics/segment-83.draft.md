## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

** Note: Assumes boats tack 90°, though the numbers change
little for narrower tacking angles.
* Trigonometric analysis of shifts fi rst appeared in Dave
Perry’s Winning in One Designs - US Sailing
Fig. 2a - Sailing upwind is like climbing a wide ladder. Boats
which are equally far upwind are on the same rung.
Fig. 2b - When the wind shifts, the ladder rotates. The boat
closet to the shift ends up on the top rung, and is ahead.
Fig. 3 - When boats are even before the shift, the boat closer
to the shift gains. In a 10° shift the gain (loss) is 25% of the
distance between the boats. Wow!
Shift ° 	0° 	5° 	10° 	15° 	20° 	45°
% Gain 	0% 	12% 	25% 	37% 	48% 	100%

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
