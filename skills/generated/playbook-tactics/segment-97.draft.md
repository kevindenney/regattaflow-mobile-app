ing, but a boat on the right controls the last starboard crossing.
Starboard roundings put a premium on controlling the right, as
the right owns both the inside position and the last starboard
crossing.
The Last Oscillation Is A Persistent Shift
In an oscillating breeze, treat the last shift before the mark
as a persistent shift. That is, sail the header to the layline, then
tack for the lift. Any leg which has just one shift should be
sailed as you would in a persistent shift. Think of the last part
of the leg as a very short leg with just one shift (Fig. 26).
Inside the Laylines
Inside the laylines, a weather quarter position gives
control, as a boat on the lee bow is pinned and not free to tack.
This position must be carried all the way to the layline or it will
be reversed if both boats tack.
A port-starboard crossing near the layline is a common
situation which offers many options and counter options.
If the port-tack boat can cross, he has several choices. He
can cross and continue on port tack toward the starboard layline;
he can tack to lee bow or cover the starboard tacker, giving the
starboard tacker incentive to tack away; or he can tack to pin the
starboard tacker and carry out to the port layline (Fig. 27).
If the port tacker cannot cross, then he can tack or duck.
If he chooses to tack, he may be pinned out until the starboard
boat tacks. A well-executed duck creates an opportunity for a
reversal at the next crossing. To prevent a reversal, the star-
board tack boat can tack and pin the port boat. If the starboard

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
