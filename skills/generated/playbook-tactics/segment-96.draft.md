achieve that goal.
Course Management is the term used to summarize your
efforts up the beat. The challenge is to look ahead, and an-
ticipate developments. When your strategy suggests one side
is favored, good course management means finding a lane of
clear air so you can get to the favored side with good speed.
Course management comes in to play as you get to the
favored side, and must once again find a clear lane from the fa-
vored side to the mark. Looking ahead, work the favored side
as hard as you can, but tack before you are forced all the way
to the outside of the crowd. Better to tack early – you can tack
out again later if you want – than to get pushed to the outside
(Fig. 24).
As the fleet converges on the mark clear air is harder to
come by. Coming in on port provides clear air – at the risk on
being frozen out on the layline (Fig. 25).
The rounding segment is next.
Fig. 25 – Later in the leg, as the fl eet
converges on the mark, positioning for
clear air gets more diffi cult
Fig. 24 - During the beat segment,
pursue your strategy. Tactically you
will need to look ahead for lanes of
clear air to the favored side, and
then to the mark. Avoid getting
pushed to the laylines - or
beyond.

Fig. 27 – If a port tacker can cross, he can then tack
and pin a starboard boat or sail on to the layline.
Fig. 28 – If the port tacker can’t
cross, he can tack (into a pin) or
duck—and get pinned to the right.
Fig. 26 – Sail into the last
oscillation going into the mark as
though it were a persistent shift.
The Rounding: Positioning for Control
Approaching the weather mark, work for control of those
nearby. Keep clear air, and try to keep from being pinned by
others. With marks to port, the left side is inside at the round-

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
