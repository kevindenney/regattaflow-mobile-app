## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Fig. 13 – The impact of wind shifts downwind is huge. With a
six-knot boat speed, and a 10° shift from a course 40° above
dead downwind, the checkered boat will sail 90 seconds per
mile faster than the white boat which ignores the shifts, and 4
minutes faster than the grey boat which gets it all wrong.
Note: If boat speeds are slower, times will be greater!
easy way. If the close hauled boats in your wind neighborhood
are on one tack, then try the opposite tack. In addition, be
cognizant of the shift pattern you noted upwind—are the puffs
all starboard tack lifts?
Finally, don’t forget to look at the water. You can see puffs
on the water surface. If your course changes with no discern-
ible change in true wind speed, you are in a shift (Fig 12).
The Impact of Shifts
In winds up to 10 knots, the impact of shifts downwind
is enormous, comparable to the impact of shifts upwind. In a
10° shift, the headed boat will gain 22% versus a boat which is
sailing lifted. A boat working the shifts will gain 10% versus a
boat which ignores the shifts. That adds up to 90 seconds per
mile for boat speeds of 6 knots (Fig. 13). At slower speeds, in
lighter winds, the time difference is even greater!
In moderate winds, the impact is somewhat diminished,
though still huge. In heavy air, there is little room to play the
shifts since the fastest course is straight to the mark.
For a boat sailing at six knots, the numbers work out like
this on a per mile basis:
Boat 	Course 	< to Rh 	VMG 	1 mile time
Black 	Lifted 10° 	50° 	3.858 	15 min 33 sec
White 	No Shifts 	40° 	4.596 	13 min 3 sec
Check 	Headed 10° 	30° 	5.196 	11 min 33 sec

Attack Downwind
More and more race committees are running windward
leeward courses instead of conventional triangles. Part of the
reason is the additional tactical challenge of running legs. To
succeed, you need to use the same aggressive approach to wind

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
