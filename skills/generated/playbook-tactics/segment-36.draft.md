No Room .
You're Barging!
Barging Zone
Below the
layline
Fig. 21a - If you fi nd yourself below the pin layline, an early
bail out can save you. 	b - Stay between the laylines and don't
barge.
Fig. 22a - If you are slow to "pull the trigger," you can get
buried at the start.
Fig. 22b - Once buried, you can hang on or tack out.
If you'd like to tack out, watch out for boats inside you
preparing to do the same. Try to spare yourself the utter frus-
tration of being tacked on just as you try to clear your air.
The tactician should have a contingency plan in mind in
the event of a bad start. Think about it before it happens, then
see to it that it doesn't.
