> MIXED C ONDITIONS EXAMPLE

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Here is an example of strategy in mixed conditions
(Fig. 13).
Pre-Race Data
Our pre-race data is listed in the Wind Graph. It shows
mixed conditions. The trend is veering, but we have oscilla-
tions as well. Our strategy will have to consider both; we will
also have to keep a keen eye out for changes in conditions.
One thing to look for is stronger breeze to one side. Is the trend
shifting and building (as in this example) or shifting and fad-
ing.
. . . And They’re Off
It is interesting to see the different strategies which
emerge from these difficult conditions. Some of the fleet will
treat the beat as though they were sailing a persistent shift.
Others will tack on the headers. Some will try to balance the
mix. And still others will be confused and uncertain of how to
handle the conditions.
As the fleet moves up the beat in mixed conditions, the
apparent leaders will change with each shift. Often it is unclear
until the last shift of the leg who will come out ahead.
Keep Fighting
In mixed conditions you are never out of it. Keep work-
ing, keep trying to decipher the next shift. There are plenty of
opportunities to catch up (and more than enough chances to get
confused). If you find yourself baffled, try to regroup. Every-
one will have their moments—if you can keep from going to
pieces during your bad moments, you’ll have another chance
for good times.
