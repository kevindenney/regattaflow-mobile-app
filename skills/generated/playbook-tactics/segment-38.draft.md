# RegattaFlow Playbook Tactics Core Concepts

## Focus
> 15. Rules

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

In addition to the regular racing rules, there are some
special rules which apply only at starts. Know the rules, and be
aware that others may not.
Starting rules are such an important topic that they deserve
a chapter all their own, which is next.
Fig. 24 - Starts require a good plan, great teamwork, and
impeccable timing.
Fig. 23 - A pincher (a) below you can ruin your start—and his
own. Try to gas off a footer (b) before the speedster rolls over
you. Sometimes you have to beat pinchers and footers at their
own game before you can sail your boat properly.
4.5 Conclusion
Starting Tactics guides us through the most important and
exciting part of sailboat racing. It is no wonder more and more
regattas are being run on short courses, with multiple races
each day: Everyone wants more chances to start.
Starts take teamwork built around a sound, flexible plan
directed toward clear strategic goals. Get the information you
need, practice your approach, and don't be late (Fig. 24).
Following are some ideas on how you can build your
starting skills:
