speed and apparent wind angle. 	where you can easily feel the lulls and puffs. Downwind the
apparent wind angle and apparent wind speed are much more
volatile. Careful study is needed to tell if a change in appar-
ent wind is due to a change in the true wind speed, true wind
direction, or in sailing angle. The spinnaker trimmer must feel
changes in the tug on the sheet and in spinnaker trim, and the
helmsman must feel the helm and note the course, speed, and
pole angle in order to differentiate lulls from lifts (Fig. 11).
Another important tool in finding the shifts is observ-
ing other boats. When you feel a change on your boat, see if
it shows on other boats. It is particularly valuable to compare
your performance to the performance of boats on the opposite
jibe. If performance on all the nearby boats is suffering, then
you are in a lull. If boats on the opposite jibe seem to be sail-
ing lower angles while carrying speed, that would suggest you
have been lifted and ought to jibe. Also, watch performance of
boats which are sailing upwind; they are still doing shift the

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
