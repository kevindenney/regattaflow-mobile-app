## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

ditions vary through the full spectrum—from shifty westerlies
in smooth water to tremendous northerlies with jaw-breaking
waves. The 300 mile long lake is capable of dishing up any-
thing at anytime. And it is all fresh water!
Southwest Winds
Sail in toward the city for better breeze and a starboard lift.
West Winds
Look for dark patches coming off the city bringing breeze
and big shifts. If you fall behind don’t split – sail to the next
shift.
Northwest Wind
With a passing cold front, the N.W. wind will blow cool
and strong. Though the breeze tends to clock to the north, you
find better breeze and port lifts inshore. Once the wind gets to
the north, the left no longer pays. Watch for the wind to clock
further.
North Wind
Sail fast and bring your foul weather gear. Even in mid-
summer, the waves can stir up cold water. Try the right.
Northeast & East Wind
Get out into the lake for better breeze.
Southeast Wind
Go left, into the lake to fresher breeze and left shift.
South Wind
South wind bends near shore, for a SW shift near shore.
But the breeze may back as the south wind may be due to a
passing low or due to a building thermal blowing on shore. If
it is cloudy, go in. Clear? Sail Fast!
