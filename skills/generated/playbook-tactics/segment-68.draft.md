## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

believe me, you’ve never tried it. But it is the right thing to do.
If the wind continues right, then there is nothing to be gained
by continuing to the left. Cut your loses, and sail to the shift.
The grey boat carries on, hoping for an oscillation. Its a
gamble – if the persistent shift continues, his position will go
from bad to worse. He’s sailing the great circle route and will
never get a good angle to sail to the mark. But, BUT, if the
wind oscillates back, (oh please, oh please) even for just a short
time, he can recover nicely. (Fig. 18)
Fig 18 – Persistent shifts – sail to the new wind!
Here are some numbers, assuming a 5° shift every 5 minutes, with the
boats sailing at 6 knots: After 20 minutes the checkered boat will be
1.5 miles upwind of the starting line, and over 1/4 mile ahead of the
black boat. The checkered boat will be on just 1/8 mile ahead of the
grey boat, but that lead will be growing quickly.
The black boat would be expected to cross the grey boat when he tacks.
