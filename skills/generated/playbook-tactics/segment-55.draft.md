and sailing on the lifted tack, we can take advantage of the
wind shifts to improve upwind performance. We use the term
staying in phase to describe the process of tacking on the head-
ers and sailing on the lifts.
Sometimes the wind shifts gradually back and forth. This
is seen most often when the winds are coming over open water.
We tack as we are headed below the average heading. At other
times the shifts hit all at once. We see this when the shifts are
coming off shore, or in the northwest winds after a cold front.
Types of Shifts
Wind shifts are generally categorized in two types: per-
sistent and oscillating. Persistent shifts swing gradually in
one direction, like the hands of a clock. A shift to the right is a
clocking shift, or “veer;” a shift to the left is called a “back.”
Oscillating winds shift back and forth, like a pendulum.
(Fig. 8 a, b)
From experience we know the real world is more complex
than simple oscillating or persistent shifts. For starters we are
going to look at strategy in these two textbook types of shifts.
After that we will look at other variations.
Persistent Shifts
The basic strategy in a persistent shift is to sail to the new
wind. As the wind gradually shifts, one tack will gradually
deteriorate, while the other improves. If the wind is shifting to
the right, then port tack will be at its best early and deteriorate
over time, while starboard tack will get better and better. We
would sail port tack first, before it is too badly headed, and sail
starboard tack later, when it is most lifted. (Fig. 9)

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
