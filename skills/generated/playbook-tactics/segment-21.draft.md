Reach Out and Back
The most commonly used approach is the Reach Out
and Back. Often the fleet moves én mass, reaching out on
port tack one and a half to two minutes before the start. At
around a minute everyone tacks back and reaches to the line,
trimming up to close-hauled for the last fifteen to thirty sec-
onds.
Advantages
The Reach Out and Back is simple.
Danger!
This approach creates clumps of boats. You want to
avoid crowds. This is also a barging set up. There are better
approaches.
The Secret to Success
The key is to hold a position with clear air in the front
row. Try to leave room for acceleration ahead and to leeward
by sweeping down and luffing up, effectively stalling while
those ahead sail further down the line. Then use the space
to accelerate. The biggest problem is keeping the space for
yourself. Some boats will try to go over and under you to
steal it; others will come in on port tack.
3.3 Approaches
The next step, after deciding where on the line to start,
is to decide how to get there. We must select our approach.
The approach we choose will form the basis of our starting
plan. There are a variety of approaches available, each with
advantages and disadvantages. It is best to be well-versed and
comfortable with each, so we can select the one which best
fits the prevailing strategic and tactical circumstances.
The approaches covered in the following pages include:
• Reach Out and Back

Another problem with the half speed approach is that
you must sail on port tack into oncoming starboard boats and
find room to make a full 180° turn.
The Secret to Success
In order to be able to accelerate readily to full speed it
