## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Fig. 13 - With the current running upwind and strongest early
in the leg the fastest course is to reach up and get across the
current quickly, then sail a broader, slower angle later.
Fig. 14 - With current pushing to weather and strong later in
the leg it is best to sail low early or you will have to fi ght the
strongest current at a poor reaching angle later.
Reaching Strategy Conclusion
Sail Fast, Sail the Rhumb Line. Sometimes strategy is just
that simple. Variables of wind, wind shifts, and current can add
some complexity, but the real excitement comes with tactics—
or lots of wind. The tactical battle for clear air and for position
at roundings or in passing lanes is where the action is.
Reaches can become parades. In similar size boats, pass-
ing can be difficult. Leaders tend to stretch out their advantage
by following the sail fast, sail straight principles, while the
rest of the fleet struggles. In mixed fleets, big boats which have
failed to round ahead roll up through the fleet, with the smaller
boats unable to stop them. It is no wonder that, to avoid reach-
ing parades, more and more races are being run on windward-
leeward courses .
Onward to Reaching Tactics, where we will battle for
clear air and work to achieve our strategic goals.
early, the lower you will have to sail later, once you are
out of the current (Fig. 13).
• Current pushing to weather and strongest at the end:
This case holds the greatest opportunities, as those who do
not anticipate the current’s set are at a distinct disadvan-
tage. As boats are pushed to weather, they are forced to
sail a lower and slower reaching angle to compensate. This
slower course increases the relative strength of the cur-
rent and compounds the error. Those who anticipate the
current’s push and set up low of the rhumb line will gain.
Of course, sailing low early in the leg is not possible if
there are rivals in hot pursuit looking to sail over you and

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
