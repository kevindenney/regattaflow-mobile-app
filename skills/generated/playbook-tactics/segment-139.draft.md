at the water and observe other boats.
Puffs and Lulls
In puffy conditions, look back to find the puffs and posi-
tion yourself downwind of them (Fig. 5). You can see them as
darker patches moving across the water, and as they influence
the performance of boats behind you. Pay attention to close-
hauled boats as well as those on the run. Puffs are easier to read
on beating boats than running boats. The proper response to a
puff depends on which segment of the performance curve you
are in. Remember, off in the puffs is wrong in light air.
Fig. 4a,b,c – In light air we sail a wide cone – nearly as wide
as the upwind cone. In moderate winds the cone narrows as
the wind increases. In heavy air we sail nealry dead down wind
and the playing fi eld is narrow.
Puffs and lulls are often accompanied by wind shifts. For
example, puffs come with shifts from the right and lulls come
with shifts from the left. It is critical to get in phase with the
shifts as well as playing the puffs. We’ll cover wind shifts in
more detail below.
In a dying breeze, work for a position which will keep you
in clear air and clear of crowds. Pay careful attention to perfor-
mance, and be sure to sail fast angles as the wind gets light. In
a building breeze, focus on getting to the new wind first; then
match your performance to the conditions. Great boat speed is
always a powerful tactic.

Fig. 6 – In oscillating shifts jibe on
the lifts and sail the headed tack— the
inverse of upwind strategy, where we tack
on the headers to sail lifted.
Wind Shifts
Wind shifts don’t stop when you round
the windward mark. You need to make the most
of wind shifts downwind, just as you do upwind.
The trouble is that downwind shifts are trickier than
upwind shifts, for a number of reasons. The upside

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
