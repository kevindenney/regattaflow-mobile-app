the fleet (and sail fast) in the early going. You want to enter the
final segment of the race in a position to win. An early gamble
can quickly turn a long race into a long delivery.
As the race progresses and you refine your weather fore-
cast, try to lead the fleet to the new wind. The first boat to the
new wind gets the biggest advantage from it. If you are sailing
upwind this usually means footing toward the shift, rather than
sailing hard on the wind. If you are sailing downwind, then
it pays to reach up a little extra to get to the shift. On a reach,
find the fastest reaching angle to carry you to the new breeze.
Sometimes the best strategy is to lock on to your chief
rivals in the race and simply sail against them. Having a com-
petitor close at hand keeps everyone more attentive.
