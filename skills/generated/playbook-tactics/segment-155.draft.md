10.7 Quiz Questions and Skill Building
A hand bearing compass is a great tool for running tactics,
just as it is upwind. Use your “puck” to sight across an LEP to
determine position, judge port/starboard crossings, and to call
laylines. Also, use the puck to measure performance against
other boats. As bearings change, you are gaining or losing. In
this way you can determine if you are sailing the correct angle
or too high/fast or too low/slow.
One area you can work on is communication, in describing
another boats performance—particularly a trailing boat.
Discuss the terms you will use. Performance should be
described in relation to your boat in a consistent format; i.e.
distance back, distance high or low, sailing angle and speed.
E.g. “Dennis is 1 length back, on our line, sailing slightly
higher and faster.”
Your tactician will need to stay a step ahead, anticipating
initial conditions on the reach—strategically and tactically—
during the fi nal segment of the beat. At times he may not be
able to know what will happen—will you round ahead or
behind some of your rivals? In that event, he may still be able
to tell you on the approach that upon rounding you will either:
Sail high with the jib on a course of xx° or set immediately on
a course of yy°—I’ll call it as soon as I can by saying either
“jib reach at xx°” or “spinnaker set to yy°.”
