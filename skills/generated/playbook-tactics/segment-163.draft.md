mark, not a tactical wide-and-close rounding.
The outside boat will end up in better position.
Fig. 12 – An outside boat must give an
inside boat room if she can. Here the white
boat arrives too late for space to be made.
Fig. 10 – If the outside boat is clear
astern, the inside boat had right of way
and can make a tactical rounding.
Sorry, no room.

Fig. 13 – Beware: No Brakes! As the inside boat makes a sharp
turn at the mark, he will slow dramatically. Don’t hit him from
behind.
Fig. 14 – Before reaching the three length zone, luff the inside
boat to force a poor rounding; allowing you to get a position
on his quarter as you round.
Rounding Tactics
Following are some tactical tricks you can use at round-
ings. If your tactics are good coming down the leg, you should
only rarely find yourself giving room.
Use a Tactical Rounding. The inside boat is not al-
lowed to make a tactical rounding, but you still should. If
you are giving room, swing wide and follow on the inside
boat’s transom, rather than pinwheel to the outside. If you
pinwheel you may end up blanketed with no way to escape.
(See Figs. 10 & 11.)
No Brakes! As you swing wide to follow, be careful not
to hit the lead boat from behind as you accelerate. His sharp
turn at the mark may leave him dead in the water. As the lead
boat, it is a good idea to slow down and force the outside boat
to the outside (Fig. 13).
Force a Bad Rounding. When you are giving room,
you can try to force the inside boat into a bad (in close and
out wide) rounding by sailing high as you approach the mark.
If you force the inside boat onto a high line approaching the
mark, she will have trouble making a good rounding. You can
then take room as necessary to round into a controlling position
coming out of the turn (Fig. 14).

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
