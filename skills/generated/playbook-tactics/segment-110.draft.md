Way rules apply. There is no Mark Room for boats on opposite
tacks at a windward mark (See Rule 18.1 b). At a port round-
ing, the port tacker must stay clear (Fig. 54).
If a port-tack boat tacks to starboard inside the three boat
length zone, then Rule 18.3 applies. If the starboard boat must
head up above close hauled to avoid the tacking boat, the tack-
ing boat has violated the rule. Furthermore, if the starboard
boat overlaps the tacking boat to the inside, the tacking boat
must give room. (Fig. 55).
The burdens on a boat tacking inside the zone are so oner-
ous that I suggest you don’t do it, and consider one of three
options:
• Come in right on the layline and tack around the mark,
minimizing your exposure. (Fig. 56 – option 1).
• Don’t tack – Cross the starboard boat (if you can) and
then tack. 	(Fig. 56 – option 2).
• Come in more than three lengths from the mark and com-
plete your tack outside the zone. 	(Fig. 56 – option 3).

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
