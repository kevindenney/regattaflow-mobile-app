Fig. 1 – Runs offer trailing boats
the chance to attack. They are the
only legs where the fl eet tends to
compress rather than stretch out.
Light Air Performance
In winds from 3 to 10 knots, sailing
angles are very wide. That is, for best perfor-
mance we do not sail directly downwind, but 40°
above a dead downwind course.
Boat speed changes dramatically as the wind
fluctuates between 3 and 10 knots, but the correct sail-
ing angle changes hardly at all. In these conditions, we will
jibing through about 80°—which is only slightly narrower than
our tacking angles upwind (Fig. 2a).
In these light air conditions the off in the puffs, up in the
lulls adage we advocated for reaching does not apply. Our
sailing angle remains steady through puffs and lulls in light air
running.
Moderate Air Performance
In moderate winds sailing angle, not boat speed, is the
dynamic variable. The correct sailing angle changes dramati-
cally—by about 5° for every knot of wind speed—from 145° in

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
