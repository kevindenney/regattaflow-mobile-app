port tack boat tacks in front of a starboard tacker. For the tack
to be legal S must be able to hold course until P completes her
tack before starting an evasive maneuver (Fig. 5).
Consider this before you tack in front of a starboard boat:
Suppose S starts her evasive maneuver earlier than she had to.
How are you going to prove she could have waited?
Right of Way Rules
So that’s it: All four Right of Way rules. The only right of
way rules in the entire 153 page rule book. Next we’ll take a
look at the General Limitations. Only four of them too.
App. 1.3 General Limitations
The four right of way rules are limited by four General
Limitations in Rules 14 –17. These limitations constrain the
Right of Way boat and also govern the transition between Right
of Way rules. Here they are:
Rule 14: Avoiding Contact
Even if you have the right of way, you must avoid contact
with other boats. Once it is clear that the keep clear boat is not
keeping clear you must act to avoid contact.
Rule 15: Acquiring Right of Way
“When a boat acquires right of way, she shall initially give
the other boat room to keep clear, unless she acquires right of
way through the other boat’s actions.”
A couple of examples: One is a boat coming from astern
and acquiring an overlap to leeward. As the overtaking boat
establishes her overlap she must allow the newly burdened boat
room and time to keep clear (Fig. 6a).
Two others involve tacking: With two boats on port, when
one tacks to starboard she must allow the newly burdened boat
room and time to keep clear, as above. With two boats on star-

most commonly when a port tack boat
tacks in front of a starboard boat.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
