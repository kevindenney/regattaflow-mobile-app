## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Obstructions (Rules 19 and 20)
When two (or more) port tack boats approach a starboard-
tack boat, the port tackers must stay clear. The starboard-tack
boat ranks as an obstruction. The port-tack boats may duck or
tack in order to keep clear. The leeward port tacker may choose
to duck and give others room to duck as well, or he may choose
to tack (Fig. 52).
If the leeward boat chooses to tack, Rule 20 requires that
he hail the boat) to windward. The windward boat must tack, or
hail “You tack,” and stay clear. The leeward boat must tack as
soon as he gets a response (either action or words).
Windward Mark Roundings
The mark rounding rules at the windward mark differ from
those on a free leg of the course. There are three basic situa-
tions:
Fig. 51 – You have tacked too close if the trailing boat must
start evasive maneuvers before you fi nish your turn.
Fig. 52 – Two port boats must stay
clear of a starboard obstruction.
Same Tack, Overlapped (Rule 11)
Windward boats must stay clear. With everyone sailing
close hauled, the windward/ leeward rules are not as volatile
upwind as they are downwind; but windward boats must still
be careful. Even if your boat is not as close winded (doesn’t
point as high) as a leeward boat, you must stay clear.
While Tacking (Rule 13) and Same Tack, Not
Overlapped (Rule 12)
After crossing head to wind, the tacking boat must com-
plete her tack (finish turning and be on course) before the right-
of-way boat initiates an evasive maneuver, or she has tacked
too close. If it comes to a protest, then not only must you tack
legally, you must also be able to prove it. Be careful (Fig. 51).
If a rival tacks in front of you then you must avoid hitting
them from astern. Alter course to avoid a collision. If you must
alter course before the tacking boat has completed her tack, she
has fouled you. Avoid a collision and protest.
