## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Inside Reaches
Inside reaches push the fleet far above the rhumb line,
since the lure of clear air and inside position at the rounding lie
on the same side. If you are the lead boat in a group, it pays to
establish an inside position immediately. As you clear the jibe
mark sail up a length or two before settling down on course. If
you don’t establish this strong position, others will be tempted
to attack. You will driven up further in the end as you work to
defend a weak position (Fig. 30).
If you find yourself in the middle of a crowd on an inside
reach, it pays to work to the inside early. Inside position and
clear air will be decisive factors, particularly as the fleet con-
verges for the rounding (Fig. 31a).
On a broad reach the tendency to sail high can push the
fleet over the mark, where it becomes necessary to jibe back. It
is a common error to sail too broad at the end of an inside reach
in an effort to avoid jibes. For those with the boat handling
skills to jibe well there is much to be gained by sailing fast
angles, and jibing into the mark (Fig. 31b).
> Fig. 31a - Break out from the pack
to get to the inside.
> Fig. 31b - On a broad reach, the
best tactic may include a strong
move to the inside and a jibe back to
the mark.
>Fig. 31c - From behind, the low
road and an end run can get you
back in contention as others battle.
< Fig. 30 - On an inside reach
establish a strong inside position to
prevent attacks.
Two other ideas deserve mention:
First, if you are part of a small group, particularly near the
lead, talk with your rivals and avoid fights. “Yo, old buddy old
pal, let’s not us get into a snit. Let’s sail fast and straight, and
get away from the teaming masses, hot on our …tails.” Once
your lead group breaks away from the crowd, you can start

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
