4.6 - Building Starting Skills
Stop and Go Drill
Park your boat (near a buoy) on a close-hauled course with
sails luffi ng, then trim and accelerate to full speed. (How
long – in time and distance – did it take to reach full speed?)
Experiment to fi nd the best angle and trim sequence (jib before
main, but by how much) for different wind and sea conditions.
Work on the stopping part too. Have crew push out on the
boom to create an air brake. You may need this someday when
you're headed for a gap which closes up in front on you - and
you'll need an alert word to call for it: "Air Brake!"
Fore Reaching
Fore Reaching is a way to park and hold position and slow
down without luffi ng. With sails trimmed close-hauled, head
up above close-hauled, but not into irons. The jib will go soft,
but not backwind – sort of a super pinch mode. Great for
holding height and slowing down at the same time.
The jib trimmer should be ready – with the sheet in hand – to
luff the jib if it starts to back. Otherwise you may be thrown
into an inadvertent tack!
To accelerate out of fore reaching bear off to close hauled or
just below and ease the sheets a few inches.
Add Timing
Using a short (fi ve minute) starting cycle, repeat your stop and
go or fore reaching drill with the goal of passing a buoy at full
speed at the gun. Luff or park far enough from the buoy to have
room to get up to full speed. How long does it take (in time and
distance)?
Circle back and do it again every fi ve minutes.
Time / Speed / Distance
How long will it take us to get to the line from here? You will
be practicing this in the timing drill above. Do it everywhere
you go—in and out of the harbor, as you approach a buoy or
crab pot or another boat. With a little practice you can refi ne

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
