approaching any leeward mark. Clear air is essential to good
speed. A finish line does offer some flexibility though. If the
line is near square, you have some latitude on where to go in
search of clear air.
You can shoot the finish downwind and coast twice as far
as you would upwind. Bear off to a run and coast to the line
with your reaching speed (Fig. 23).
Downwind Finishing Rules
The rules at the finish line are the same as those on the
course; near the marks the mark-room rules apply (Fig. 24).
Fig. 24 – Near the ends, mark-room
rules prevail. At the middle of the line,
the downwind sailing rules govern.
Fig. 23 – The upwind end is favored for a
downwind fi nish. Sail proper angles and
shoot the fi nish by coasting on a run.
Fig. 22 – Rules at an upwind fi nish are
the same as those at a windward mark:
Starboard/Port for boats on opposite tacks;
mark-room for boats on the same tack.
