for the wind itself. In this way we create a graphic representa-
tion of the wind trend.
Wind Graph Example
The example on the following page shows a sample plot.
Our initial port and starboard headings at 11:02 were 150° on
starboard, and 240° on port. This corresponds to a wind direc-
tion of 195°. Subsequent readings on starboard of are 150°,
160°, 155°, 165°, and so on. On port-tack the sequence is
240°, 245°, 250°, then 260°, and so on.
After we record port and starboard numbers we average
them and record a wind direction: 195° ,195° ,195° ,205° ,215°
,200° and so on in this example. After plotting wind direction
and offsetting the numbers right or left, we can connect a string
of readings into a graphic representation of the wind. This
graphic will help us see trends and anticipate subsequent shifts.
This example shows the wind oscillating back and forth,
and gradually shifting to the right - or so it seems.
Another Way
The process of plotting this information requires a lot of
time and attention. An alternative is to purchase, install, cali-
brate, and maintain a set of integrated true wind instruments
networked with a computer to record and display the informa-
tion. When working well, these systems are awesome.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
