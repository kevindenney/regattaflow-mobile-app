## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Fig. 9 – To stay in front, you can’t
just cover. You have to keep doing
the things that got you there. Lead
to the shifts; don’t simply tack in
response to the trailing boat’s tack.
Keep the Initiative
Real leaders continue to lead. To keep the lead, you must
keep the initiative. Sail fast, hit the shifts, and do the things
you did to get the lead. Pay attention to those behind you, yes;
but think in terms of stretching the lead and adding a cushion
rather than simply going into a defensive shell and sitting on
the lead you’ve got. You certainly don’t want to split with the
fleet, but you have to do more than look back and cover. The
true champions pay attention to the fleet behind them; but they
keep working, keep hitting the shifts, keep looking ahead. (I’ve
yet to test this myself, but I’m ready to give it a try). (Fig. 9).
All too often, sailors change their tactics once in the lead,
and lose the initiative. Maybe you’ve experienced this. You
kick and scratch and fight your way to the lead. Once you get
there, you start to shake, you feel queasy, and your look back
instead of ahead. Take a deep breath, and keep plugging.
When you’re sailing with a comfortable lead, proper po-
sitioning can help protect it. If the next shift or the mark is to
the left, then position yourself to protect your left. Use a loose
cover (details below) and don’t let trailing boats get enough
leverage to threaten your lead.
Wind Shift Prospectus
Playing shifts carries inherent risks. While much can
be gained, one should not lose sight of the risks involved. Be
aware that past shift performance is not a guarantee of future
shifts. Read the prospectus in full before leveraging.
The gains made on shifts can be fleeting. While you
may gain on the shift, the gain is not realized until you tack
on the shift and cross between the wind and your rivals. Until
the gain is realized, it can vanish as quickly as it appeared.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
