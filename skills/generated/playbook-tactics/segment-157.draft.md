## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Fig. 1a – When a boat is passing to windward, a leeward boat
may change course provided she gives the windward boat
room to keep clear.

If the overtaking boat establishes an overlap to leeward
within two boat lengths, then he shall not sail above her proper
course (Rule 17) (Fig. 1b).
The definition of keep clear requires that the windward boat
establish his overlap in such a way that the leeward boat could
change course without immediately making contact with the wind-
ward boat. In other words, when the windward boat establishes
his overlap, he must allow himself room to keep clear.
Other Downwind Rules
Two other downwind situations deserve mention. First,
a boat clear astern must keep clear (Rule 12). Second, a
starboard-tack boat has right of way over a port-tack boat
