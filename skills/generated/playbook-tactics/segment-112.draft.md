Fig. 59 – A boat which hits
the mark must do a 1 Turn
Penalty.
Fig. 58 – With marks to
starboard, the port boat
should stall to let starboard
cross. Starboard is subject to
Rule 13: While Tacking if she
passes head to wind.
Marks To Starboard
The mark rounding rules are the same when marks are
to starboard, but they do not work as cleanly. At a starboard
rounding, the starboard tacker has right of way while on
course, but is not entitled to tack in a port tacker’s path. The
port tacker must stall, duck, or tack away while the starboard
tack boat crosses ahead. The situation gets unruly during a
crowded starboard rounding (Fig. 58).
Hitting The Mark (Rule 31)
A boat which hits a mark must immediately get clear of other
boats and do a One-Turn Penalty before proceeding. While doing
a penalty turn, a boat has no rights and must stay clear of all other
boats. If the boat was wrongfully pushed into the mark, she may
proceed, but she must protest the offending boat (Fig. 59).
< Fig. 56 – The burdens of Rule 18.3 are
such that you should avoid tacking inside the
3 length zone. Try tacking around the mark,
crossing, and then tacking, or tacking outside
the zone.
Fig. 57a – An inside boat gets
Mark-Room, including room to
tack.
Option 3
Option 2
Option 1
Fig. 57b – A boat clear ahead gets
Mark-Room, but NOT room to tack.

8.7 A Tactician’s Nightmare
There are a number of classic situations which make tacti-
cians toss and turn. Here’s one example:
Persistent or Oscillating
We were out early before the start, and got great data. The
wind graph shows oscillations, and we’ve been playing them
like a fiddle. Up the first beat we hit every shift. We held the
lead downwind, and now we’ve turned upwind again.
Pretty much the same numbers as the first beat, so we’re
hitting the shifts as before. On starboard now, and lifted.
Stretching out our advantage. 	A little more lift now, and we

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
