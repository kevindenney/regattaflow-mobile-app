hadn’t planned to tack, but couldn’t pass up the opportunity to
face on your rival. Trouble is, you were going the right way,
towards a shift perhaps. Now you have traded places. You are
going the wrong way, and you have forced your rival to go
where you wanted to go. Sucker.
Don’t lose sight of your strategy as you play tactical
games (Fig. 35).
No!

Fig. 38 – A Slam Dunk is used by a
starboard-tack boat to pin a port tacker.
It doesn’t always work.

another boat will push the rival back.
Slam Dunk
The Slam Dunk is a technique for pinning a port-tack boat
after he ducks a starboard-tack boat. Immediately after the port
tacker ducks, the starboard boat tacks.
The Slam Duck often does not work. The Slam Dunk is a
good way to pin a rival out to the starboard tack layline if it is
not too far away, but over time the leeward boat can often gas
off the windward boat (Fig. 38).
Using Your Wind Shadow
You can slow another boat by positioning your wind
shadow on him. Once in your wind shadow, the opponent can
either sail slowly or tack away.
From Directly Upwind
The simplest way to attack another boat is to position
yourself directly upwind. This is the epitome of a tight cover.
When tacking into this position, remember that you want to be
directly upwind after you finish your tack and regain speed. It
is common for attacking boats to tack too late and let the target
boat break through (Fig. 39).
From Ahead
Another effective position for attack is directly in line
with the opponent. The turbulence off your sails will foul the
air for a several boat lengths off your stern. To assure that your
opponent cannot escape your wind shadow without tacking,
aim for a position between directly upwind and ahead (Fig. 40).
From the Lee Bow
As the name suggests, a lee bow position is on the leeward
