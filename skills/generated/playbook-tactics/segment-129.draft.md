## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Fig. 20 - Don’t over react if your air is not threatened.
By heading up half as much as the attacker, you sail
less extra distance—and extend your lead.
Fig. 21 - Defend with vigor, or let the attacker pass. The worst
thing you can do is a halfhearted defense which takes you both
“to the moon.” Often a quick, preventive luff followed by a
smooth return to course will give you a little breathing room.
to as close as you can to course. Holding a high line only
lengthens the leg for you.
• Don’t overreact (Fig. 20).
If you have a lead of two boat lengths or more, then your
response should be tempered. The Rule of Halves works
well here—head up half as far as the rival to keep position
between him and the mark. By sailing only half as far off
course you will sail less distance. Don’t forget: The best
defense against attack is to extend your lead.
• All or nothing (Fig. 21).
When under an immediate threat defend vigorously, or not
at all. When an opponent makes a move to pass, respond
hard and fast, with a vigorous luff and trim. As the attacker
responds to your defense, come back down and squirt out
to establish a small lead. If you are not prepared for a vig-
orous defense, you will be better off to let them pass and
get on with it. Avoid a halfhearted luffing dual, as you will
both go to the moon!
• Act First
If your attacker establishes a small overlap on your weath-
er quarter but has yet to make a full run to get over you, a
preemptive luff may catch him off guard. The panicked re-
sponse will leave him in disarray, and your smooth return
to course will give you an edge—both in position and in
psyche.

Sometimes the battle is not worth it. To let the other boat
go by either sail high and wave him through to leeward—pre-
ferred for you, but he may not take the bait, as he is likely to
