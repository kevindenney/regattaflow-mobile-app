# RegattaFlow Playbook Tactics Core Concepts

## Focus
> 7. Faster than Full Speed?

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Full speed is passé. Our goal is to hit the starting line at
faster than full speed. But how?
If you have room to leeward to drive down the line you
can accelerate on a close reach to speeds faster than close-
hauled. When you trim up to course you will carry the extra
speed for a few boat lengths—enough to squirt you out in front
of the pack as you come off the line (Fig. 10). We won’t settle
for full speed anymore—we want to come off the line faster
than full speed!!
being over early; boats which are too far back will be in bad
air. This is a difficult balance to strike (Fig. 8).
The more room you can preserve in front of you for ac-
celeration the easier it will be to preserve space to leeward,
which you can use later if needed. If you use up your forward
space, you will be forced to drive down and give up some of
your cushion to leeward. You may even be driven down into
the exhaust of the boat to leeward.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
