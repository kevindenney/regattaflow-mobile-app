## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Fig. 12 – Sailing up the middle allows you to
play the shifts and cover the fl eet; but the middle
can be pretty messy if you aren’t near the front.
Then you might have to pick a side.
Fig. 13 – Once you reach the
layline, you run out of options. You
are vulnerable to attack, and the
shifts no longer help you.
Fig. 14 – Don’t split with the fl eet. If
the fl eet is going the right way, then
splitting only leaves you further behind.
it better. When you are on the favored side, there is no need to
split. Just stay on the favored side of the fleet.
The real application for this principle is sailing to a fa-
vored side when you are behind. It is true that you can’t win by
following, but tacking away will only make matters worse. Un-
til the leaders make a mistake, you won’t catch ‘em. Hang on
even if it hurts, and stay close. Tacking away from the favored
side or a persistent shift is not the answer. You’ll get a chance
to fight back if you stay close, and you’ll get hammered if you
go the wrong way. Rather than tack and follow, lead the fleet
to the next shift – if you can find it. (Fig. 14).
fleet, really. When the entire fleet goes left, the middle goes left
with the fleet.
Avoid the Laylines
Once you hit the layline, you are out of options. You are
subject to attack, and you are hurt by any shift (Fig. 13).
Avoiding the laylines is a good principle, with few excep-
tions. The most notable exception is in the middle of a huge
fleet. First, you will be forced out of the middle by traffic.
Then, as you approach the mark, the turbulence and disturbed
air between the laylines must be avoided; often by sailing a few
boat lengths beyond the layline to get clear air. Until you have
approached the windward mark 52nd in a fleet of 63, you don’t
know how bad bad air can be.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
