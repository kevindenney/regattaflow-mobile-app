## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

To make your attack work, you should jibe early and sail
down on your rival, cutting off the escape route. Sail down un-
til the rival is aligned with your windex. If you are within three
or four mast heights, you will have an impact. Watch to see his
spinnaker curl as he enters your shadow … and look back to be
sure no one is doing the same to you (Fig. 20b).
The closer you get, the greater your effect. If the leader
jibes back out, you do the same. Get into attack position and
be ready to strike again when he jibes in. Your frequent attacks
will challenge each boats jibing skills. Practice those jibes.
Keeping Clear Air
As a lead boat, the challenge is it to keep clear air while
implementing your strategy. Work the shifts or favored side,
and look for lanes which will allow you to sail the middle in
clear air. If you are threatened by a pack of trailing boats chas-
ing you to the outside of the leg you may need to jibe early and
reach up to break across their wind shadow.
Remember, jibes (which is to say, good jibes) cost very
little. Be a moving target. Don’t let attackers set up on you. As
you work toward the favored side, a quick jibe and jibe back
can throw off an attacker; or give you a position for a later jibe
which will allow you to break through to the inside. If you find
your air threatened, reach up to break through or jibe away im-
mediately. Don’t delay (Fig. 21).
Sailing down the middle of the leg can be difficult in the
middle or forward sections of a large fleet. Look for lanes of
clear air and try to find a position inside a pack of potential
attackers. Anticipate their jibes to keep out of their shadows
(Fig.22).
