# RegattaFlow Playbook Tactics Core Concepts

## Focus
> 2. Luff into irons on the line (or off one end).

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Sight across your boat (using the traveler bar, e.g..);
your sight will be square to the wind. While this is
a popular technique, I recommend against it for two
reasons: First, you must redo it every time the wind
shifts; second, it is hell on your sails—the worst thing
you can do to them (Fig. 5).
The Set of the Line
The set of the line means the angle of the line to the
wind. Since we are racing upwind, there is an advantage to
starting at the end which is furthest upwind—we call this
the favored end. A starting line set perpendicular to the wind
does not have a favored end. When the line is not square to
the wind then one end—the upwind end—is favored (Fig. 3).
Two questions come to mind:
Q1. How can you figure out which end is favored?
Q2. How much difference does it make?
Q1. Which End is Favored?
There are several ways to find the favored end of the
starting line. Some are better than others:

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
