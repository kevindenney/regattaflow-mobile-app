speed until you do tack, and may actually allow you to tack
sooner! Plus, you avoid the hazards of barging (see Chapter
5: Starting Rules for more on barging), and of other crowd-
related problems (Fig. 12).
How badly do you need to be the first boat to tack out?
What are the odds of pulling it off? Can you afford the risk
of being buried? How does that compare with the much
higher percentage play of being the third boat to tack by start-
ing down the line?
Go Left!
If everything favors the left side, then get ready to
battle! There is little margin for error in these starts, and few
spaces in the front row when the pin end is favored. The
boat furthest left may be the only one with clear air, but any
hesitation may allow the next boat up the line to roll over the
top. Again, a start part way up the line may be the easiest way
to get the second best start (Fig. 13). You'll be able to create
space for clear air and room to accelerate. In fact, a jam up
at the pin may leave you with the best start! Plus you control
the center and the first tack. We'll look at the tactics of this
position in detail in the next chapter.
Hit the Shifts
The best start in shifty conditions is one which allows
you to sail to the shift with speed and affords you the room
to tack when the shift arrives. Blast off from the middle of
the line, tack if the next shift is coming from the right, and
sail fast. When racing to a shift, speed is more important
than pointing, and room to tack is critical if you are going to
take advantage of the shift when you get to it. Stay clear of
crowds and sail fast.
Fig. 12 - To go right, try a start just below
the crowd at the boat end. You can get
off the line with clear air and be a leader
going to the favored side.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
