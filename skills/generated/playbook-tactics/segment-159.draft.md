## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Rounding through Gates
When the leeward mark is set as a gate, you must choose
which side to round. Much like a starting line, the choice
depends on three factors: which mark is to the favored side,
which end is furthest upwind, and which mark is least crowded.
As these factors are often in conflict, the decision can be diffi-
cult. If the gate is set out of square to the wind by 10°, then the
advantage at the upwind end equals half the distance between
the marks. Equally difficult are the boat handling gyrations
needed to accommodate a last minute change of tactics (Fig. 4).
Once an end has been selected, then the rules and tactics
are like those at any single mark. Just beware the rules as you
crisscross with a competitor who has selected the other end!
Rounding with Company
When rounding with company, Rule 18: Passing Marks
and Obstructions governs. This rule is the source of many pro-
tests and appeals, most of which involve the elusive three boat
length zone.
Fig. 4 – When rounding through gates, pick the favored side
– then change your mind at the last instant to challenge your
crew! The rules are the same as those at leeward marks.
Fig. 5 – As the outside boat reaches the three length zone, any
boat overlapped inside is entitled to room at the mark. The grey
boat does not get room, and the white and black boats are entitled
to room regardless of what may happen later. (See Fig. 6.)
