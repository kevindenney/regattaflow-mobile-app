Port Tack Fetch
When a big left hand shift makes the first leg a port tack
fetch (or near fetch), blast off the line on port tack. The fleet
tends to bunch up at the port end to the line, barely fetching or
not fetching the line on starboard tack. Avoid the jam up, and
start in the middle of the line.
Two approaches are recommended. One is a port tack
approach, ducking starboard tackers, and finding a gap in the
crowd. The other is a starboard approach. Sail up the line on
starboard, find an open space, and tack. Allow time to build
speed on port. Regardless of approach, the goal is to reach in
and blast off!
From a midline position you will be ahead and to leeward
of the pack. If the breeze backs further, you may fetch. If the
breeze clocks, you will lead the fleet into the header. Mean-
while, the pack at the port end will be jammed up, sailing the
wrong way, and unable to tack out (Fig. 4).
6.3 Starts on One-Legged Beats
When a big wind shift turns the first leg of a race into a
fetch or near fetch, starting tactics change. Typically the line is
square to the mark (and original wind) and heavily skewed to
the new wind.
Ideally, when there is a big shift before the start of a race,
the Race Committee will delay the start and reset the course,
but that is not always the case. When a shift turns the first leg
into a one-legged beat, the goal of starting strategy is to get off
the line, with speed, sailing on the tack to the mark. The exact
position on the line is not important. Lets take a look at the two
cases: Port tack fetch and starboard tack fetch.

starboard boats, or approach on
starboard and tack into a hole. The
critical thing is to blast off on port tack.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
