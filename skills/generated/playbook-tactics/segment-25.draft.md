tack into a gap.
Advantages
A port tack approach allows you to set up late and avoid
clumps of boats which have set up early. It protects you from
attack, and allows you to attack others if you choose.
Danger!
As with the Port Approach for a Pin End Start, there are
right-of-way hazards and the challenge of tacking and accel-
erating late in the sequence.
The Secret to Success
This is a great set up for a midline start. Your tactician
should be looking ahead to find a gap. Once you find a gap,
the key is to tack into the windward edge, leaving room to
drive off to leeward and accelerate. Allow plenty of time to
search out a gap, tack, and get up to speed. Again, good crew
work is essential to a smooth tack and quick acceleration.
