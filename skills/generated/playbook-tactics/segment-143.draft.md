Oscillating vs. Persistent
There will be times when you will have oscillating shifts
upwind and persistent shifts downwind. By persistent shifts, we
mean that there is only one shift for the duration of the leg—
consequently your strategy is persistent shift strategy. This can
occur any time the downwind shift frequency is more than half
the sailing time of the leg, which means upwind you would
experience three or four shifts (Fig. 10b).
The main point remains to sail away from the shift, and
then jibe to sail headed, regardless of the frequency of shifts.
Just be aware that there may not be very many shifts to hunt.
One further insight: Don’t be deceived by the change to persis-
tent shifts downwind. When you turn upwind, the oscillations
will return.
Find the Shifts
As we said above, one of the tricks to downwind strategy
is detecting wind shifts. One way to take the mystery out of
downwind shifts is properly calibrated true wind instruments.
With integrated instruments, the shifts are much easier to find.
It is almost like cheating. Careful calibration is a must. Other-
wise it is “garbage in, garbage out.”
Here’s how to find the shift if you are sailing without inte-
grated instruments. (And of course, even if you have high-tech
instruments, you should use them as adjuncts to methods we’ll
describe, not in lieu of them.) First, after rounding the wind-
ward mark settle onto the correct tack—the headed tack you
noted at the end of the beat, and the proper performance angle
and speed—as described in Downwind Performance above,
and in RegattaFlow Playbook. Racing Trim. Once you settle, note your wind
angle, boat speed, and compass course. To find the shifts, you
must look for changes in this base line performance.
only one-third as many shifts downwind as upwind. In heavier
winds the ratio remains about two-to-one.
Only when the wind is very strong does the frequency of
shifts upwind and downwind converge significantly. By then
you can stop looking for shifts downwind—just hang on, hoot
and holler.
There are a couple of interesting consequences to the

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
