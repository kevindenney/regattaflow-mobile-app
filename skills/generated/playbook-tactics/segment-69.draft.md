## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

The Impact of Oscillations
We’ll start first with a boat sailing upwind, with a tack-
ing angle of 90°. Using trigonometry (yikes), we find that the
distance sailed is 1.42 times the straight-line distance. To sail to
a mark one mile upwind, the boat will have to sail a total of .71
miles on port tack, and .71 miles on starboard tack.
If the wind is oscillating as little as 5° either side of the
median, then performance improves significantly. To sail to a
mark one mile upwind, the boat will have to sail a total of .65
miles on port tack, and .65 miles on starboard tack. By taking
advantage of the shifts, the distance sailed is reduced to 1.30
times the straight-line distance. That’s a savings of over a tenth
of a mile – over 600 feet!
If the wind is oscillating 10° either side of the median,
then performance improves dramatically. To sail to a mark one
mile upwind, the boat will have to sail a total of .61 miles on
port tack, and .61 miles on starboard tack. By taking advantage
of the shifts, the distance sailed is reduced from 1.42 to 1.22
times the straight line distance. A savings of .20 miles, which
is nearly 15%, or about 1200 feet! (Fig. 19)
At a boat speed of 6 knots this represents 120 seconds – or
two minutes in one mile! These numbers are for big right or
left shifts – not a gradual oscillation, and for a boat sailing the
wind shifts perfectly. But even at 25% effi ciency, you’ll still
save 30 seconds per mile!
Hit the shifts!

7.6 Current
Current adds complexity to strategic planning. The obvi-
ous, and primary, strategic concern is to seek out better (more
favorable or less adverse) current. When the current is not uni-

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
