# RegattaFlow Playbook Tactics Core Concepts

## Focus
> THE PERFORMANCE PYRAMID :

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Not only do Boat Handling and Boat Speed form the base of
the pyramid, they are also performance factors entirely within
our control. Tactics, on the other hand, involves weather and
other boats—factors which are decidedly unpredictable.
!
Conclusion: Good luck in all your racing…
… and don’t believe everything you read!!
When your boat handling is second nature, and your boat
speed is second to none, you will find that, all of a sudden, you
are a tactical wizard.
You should use tactics and strategy to advantage when
you have an edge—when you can predict what is going on and
control events. When you can’t predict what is going to hap-
pen, your best tactic is to minimize the impact of weather, and
focus your attention on boat handling and boat speed.
Often the best strategic objective is to minimize the im-
pact of the unknown and let your boat speed prevail. Tactically
this means putting your boat in a position where you can sail
full speed, in clear air, free from crowds; yet without sailing to
the strategically fraught edges of the course.
