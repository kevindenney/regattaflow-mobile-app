## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

sail your boat.
If you are in a small boat near the head of the pack as you
turn down the reaches, the get passed lane may be the place for
you. Also, work for position to hitch a ride and surf a passing
boat’s stern wave.
As a big boat in the lead, you must get away from the
crowd. Any time you waste diddling with other boats will cost
you double, as every moment you spend with slower rated
boats leaves you less time to build a sufficient time margin.
When working to pass a fleet of smaller boats get up and over
the crowd, or well below them. Beware the low road. Although
you may be able to sail through one or two smaller boats with
ease the cumulative wind shadow of a gaggle of them can pre-
vent you from getting through.
If your boat performs poorly on reaches, you should work
to clog things up for the fast reaching boats. Once you round
the windward mark in good position you can hold off the fast
boats two ways: One is to establish a position to weather, as
described earlier (See Fig. 19). The other is to set up low, and
luff. This can have a cumulative effect. As you luff one boat he
will push up the next boat and so on. You can clog up the entire
fleet this way.

reaches turn into runs when
the reaching angle is broader
than the correct sailing angle
for the given wind speed.
