rivals. The interaction of attack and response challenges our
skills to react as situations evolve. We must consider not only
the boats at hand, but also the rest of the fleet and our overall
race strategy as we make split second decisions. This is hard!
Not only that, but if the wind is shifty we can lose hun-
dreds of yards in a matter is minutes. This is scary!
Maybe we’d be better off eliminating tactics from our rac-
ing, or at least minimizing their impact, but how?
No More Tactics
The trick is to rely on things you can control: boat han-
dling and boat speed. Then you can minimize the impact of
things you can’t control: the wind and other boats. Do this by
positonong the boat clear of traffic, in lanes of clear air that
allow you to sail your boat at full speed. (You can find clear air
by sailing off to the sides of the course, but that leaves you at
the mercy of the shifts. The trick is to control leverage while
maintaining clear air – no mean feat.)
The more you can rely on things you can control, the less
you will have to rely on things you can’t (Fig. 61).
