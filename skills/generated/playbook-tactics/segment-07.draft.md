At the Starting Area…
Plan to arrive at the starting area one full hour before the
race. During that hour you will have to plan strategy, make sail
selections, and tune up. A routine checklist of pre-race respon-
sibilities can make sure you touch all the bases. You can doubt-
less add to the list presented here.
One of the most valuable things you can do is to sail the
entire course in miniature. This means sail the compass course
of each leg in sequence. Here is what you will learn (Fig. 1):
• Are the windward legs balanced (with equal time on each
tack) or are they skewed?
• As with upwind legs, are the downwind legs square to
the wind, or are they unbalanced?
• If the course is a triangle or trapezoid, are the reaches
close or broad? This will help determine tactics at the
windward mark rounding and at the jibe mark. It will
also help the crew position the spinnaker pole properly
for initial trim.
• If the reach is a close reach, how much would the wind
have to shift to make the leg a jib reach?
Sailing the course in miniature will give your crew the big
picture, and allow them to plan ahead. The wind conditions are
likely to change over the course of the race. Sailing the course
in miniature will provide a base line to help you anticipate the
impact of those changes.
If time allows then sail the full course to get a feel for
geographic shifts and changes in conditions across the course.
Also, if gate marks are set, get a bearing on the gate to aid in
calculating the favored side of the gate.
Most of the information you need to gather prior to the
start can be compiled in a Race Planner, such as the one shown
in the next section. Of particular importance is the wind infor-
mation you compile.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
