Speed Reading
If you are looking for an answer to a particular question,
you can skim quickly by reading the illustration captions and
studying the illustrations. When you hit upon an area of partic-
ular interest, dig into the text for more details. You can also use
this skimming technique for a quick review (Fig. 1).
Understanding the Illustrations
Most of the illustrations show the evolution of a tactical
situation over time. Generally the checkered boat is the object
boat discussed in the captions and text, with the black hulled
boat or dark sailed boat as the key adversary. Other boats of
varying shades and designs are used to fill out the scene.
A key to the symbols used to depict sequential action, the
path of a boat, and an alternative path, the wind, windshifts,
and current is shown on the following pages.

question, or just want to skim the book, read the captions.

Wind moving down the course.
Here we see oscillations moving
down the courseas patches of wind with
wind arrows to show direction
Wind
A bigger arrow
represents more wind.
(If not shown, assume the wind
is blowing from the top of the page.)
Wind Shifts A dot dashed line from
one wind arrow to
another shows a wind shift
Current
Squiggly arrows are used
to depict current.
As with wind, a bigger
arrow means stronger current.

Each boat on a path is presented in time sequence to other
boats on other paths. ie. The first boat on one path corresponds
in time to the first boat on any other path, and so on.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
