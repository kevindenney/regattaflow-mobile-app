leave you sailing a low, slow
course later in the leg. Fig 10 - Use a range or bearing, either
ahead or aft, to determine if you are
correcting suffi ciently for current.

Fig. 11 - When current is strongest early in the leg and is
pushing to leeward, don’t worry if you can’t hold the rhumb
line. You will be able to make up ground later.
Fig. 12 - When the current is
strong later and is pushing to
leeward, set up high if the leg is
a close reach. On a broad reach,
head up for speed and let the
current set you down later.
rhumb line, fear not. As the current abates, you will not
have to sail such a high compass course to make the mark.
Furthermore, less current will shift your apparent wind
aft, allowing you to sail a higher compass course with the
same apparent wind angle (Fig. 11). For further discussion
of the current’s impact on sailing wind, see Chapter 13:
Weather.
• Current pushing to leeward and strongest at the end:
On a close reach you will want to set up by sailing a high
line early to assure a fetch. On a broader reach don’t hesi-
tate to sail a higher, faster reaching angle early on, with
the knowledge that the current will set you down to the
mark later in the leg (Fig. 12).
• Current pushing to weather and strongest at the outset:
Reach up to get across the current quickly, and you’ll
spend less time fighting it. But beware: the higher you go
The component of the current which is aligned with the
course, either on the bow or on the stern, effectively lengthens
or shortens the leg. The case where the current is at your stern
is the more interesting, as it tends to exaggerate the impact of
any distance you are pushed laterally. Boats which are high
of course will have to bear off even more to get down to the
mark, compounding their difficulties (as in fig 9 on the previ-

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
