## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

in Chapter 8: Upwind Tactics).
The fundamental goal of the rules is to prevent collisions.
Our racing rules are derivative of The Rules of the Road which
govern shipping. But the purpose of the rules goes beyond
“preventing collisions at sea.”
As Dave Perry explains it, “the rules are the game. With-
out rules we would have no game. If we don’t sail by the same
rules, we are not playing the same game.”
It is true, the right-of-way rules are basically the same
as the rules used to prevent collisions between ships at sea.
But they do much more. From the rules, we get much of our
close-quartered tactics, for it is the rules which define what we
can and cannot do. Furthermore, the rules are more than just
right-of-way rules. The Racing Rules of Sailing cover how
races are to be run and how violations are handled. The rules
also govern sailing situations which do not involve right of way
between boats.
While any racing sailor should be familiar with the full
rule book, we will start by covering the Right of Way rules,
their General Limitations, and the Mark Room rules.
The US Sailing rule book runs 153 pages, yet all the Right
of Way Rules fit on a single page, the General Limitations take
one additional page, and the Mark Room rules take two pages.
App. 1.2 The Four Right of Way Rules
Their are only four right-of-way rules. If you are new to
the rules, you should start by learning these. They cover most
situations. Once these are clear look at the four General Limi-
tations which temper the right of way and govern the transi-
tions and conflicts between the right of way rules.
Rule 10: On Opposite Tacks
A port-tack boat shall keep clear.
The starboard–port rule is one we use every race. It ap-
plies whenever boats are on opposite tacks, even if one is sail-
ing close-hauled and the other is running.
A close crossing situation upwind is a common source of
protests, and the port-tack boat rarely survives such a protest.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
