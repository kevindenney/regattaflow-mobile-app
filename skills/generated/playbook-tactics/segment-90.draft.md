## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Tacking to consolidate your gains is a transaction cost – think
of a good tack as a form of discount brokerage.
When behind, splitting tacks with the leaders is not
always sound strategy. While you may gain on a wind shift,
you are at least as likely to lose, as the leaders are (more often
than not) going the right way. They are, after all, in the lead.
The prudent tactician will not split tacks on a whim in
hope of getting lucky; but will sail fast, and go the same way
as the leaders when the leaders are going the right way in or-
der to stay within striking distance. Then, when an opportuni-
ty arises to catch a shift the leaders miss, the prudent tactician
will still be close enough to catch up. Remember, you can get
plenty of leverage in a hurry (if you are not too far behind), so
stay close, sail fast, be patient, and look for your opportunity.
When you do get a chance to split or lead to a shift, don’t
get greedy. Rather than try to catch up all at once, sometimes
it is better to just get closer. Gain back half the distance,
rather than push too far and suffer a reversal as the shift dis-
solves.
Boatspeed, while offering less immediate rewards, can
provide a more consistent and reliable return with less risk.
Boatspeed remains entirely within your control, unlike wind
shifts, which are subject to the vagaries of the weather.
A mixed portfolio of competitive tools has historically
provided the most consistent results.

and you may lose the opportunity.
Fig. 11 – Don’t let others cross you. Once you let others cross,
you have conceded your position. Stay to the (favored) side,
and catch up on the next shift.	8.3 Tactical Principles
There are a number of general tactical principles to keep
in mind as you sail upwind. The overall objective—your up-
