## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Since the performance cone is narrow, defending boats
have a difficult time escaping an attack. As an attacker, put
your wind shadow on the bow of the lead boat and reel them in.
On a skewed leg you can attack leaders by sailing over
their air on a broach reach before settling on their air, wing
and wing. If you are in the lead, do most of your reaching first,
across the windward edge of the cone. If you run first, you may
find yourself reaching in bad air later on. Try to save some
of your reaching for the final segment of the leg, as the extra
speed and maneuverability gives you an advantage as boats
converge at the mark (Fig. 27).
10.6 Conclusion
Downwind legs present all the strategic and tactical chal-
lenge of upwind sailing with the added challenge of spinnaker
handling and trim. While most racers are attuned to upwind

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
