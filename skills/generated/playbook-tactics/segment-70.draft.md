form across the course, it can be an overriding strategic factor.
Currents run stronger in deep water than in shallow, and faster
in narrows than in open water. Below points and around bends,
eddies can develop. They can race across flats. 	Adding further
complexity is the fact that currents change. Correct strategy can
change dramatically over a period of hours. Storms and strong
winds can distort surface currents and delay tides, sometimes
making tide tables useless (Fig. 20).
Wind Driven Current
Currents are not limited to rivers and tidal basins. In the
Great Lakes, for example, currents of one full knot are possi-
ble. Currents build when strong winds drive the surface water.
After the winds abate, the currents reverse as the water, which
has been stacked up at one end of the lake, returns to level
(Fig. 21).
Uniform Across the Course
When the current is uniform throughout the course, it af-
fects the laylines and sailing angles to the mark. If it is running
across the course, then it can also change the balance of time
spent on each tack (Fig. 22).
Fig. 21– Wind can create current. Wind driven current can
exaggerate or reverse tidal currents in shallow bays. And it
can create currents where there otherwise would be none.
After the wind has pushed water to one end of a basin, the
current will reverse when the wind subsides.
Fig. 20– Currents are created by tides and rivers. They run
stronger in channels than in shallows, and can be a major
strategic factor.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
