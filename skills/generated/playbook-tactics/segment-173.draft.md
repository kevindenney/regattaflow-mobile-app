Rule 11: On the Same Tack, Overlapped
A windward boat shall keep clear.
The windward–leeward rule is one of the simplest in the
book. The leeward boat has right of way and the windward
boat must keep clear (Fig. 2a). This rule applies to all boats
on the same tack and overlapped even if they are on different
points of sail (Fig. 2b).
Wow. We are half way through the Right of Way rules.
Rule 12: On the Same Tack, Not Overlapped
A boat clear astern shall keep clear.
An overtaking boat must keep clear of a boat clear ahead.
This rule, like the windward–leeward rule, applies to boats on
the same tack regardless of point of sail (Fig. 3).
To differentiate Rules 11 & 12 we need to define an over-
lap: A boat is clear astern if she is aft of a line abeam of the
stern of the boat clear ahead. Otherwise, they are overlapped
(Fig. 4).
Once again, while the rule itself is straightforward, the
transitions to windward–leeward and starboard–port are ad-
dressed in General Limitations.
Rule 13: While Tacking
A tacking boat shall keep clear of other boats.
Rule 13 actually starts, “After passing head to wind..”.
During the initial part of tacking – from close-hauled to head to
wind – the rule does not apply. It is only during the second half
of the tack – from head to wind until she is on the new close-
hauled course that the rule kicks in. If you head up from close-
hauled and then abort the tack and bear off to your old course,
then you have not tacked, and Rule 13 never applies.
The most common infraction of Rule 13 occurs when a

clear astern White and Black are
overlapped, and White is likewise

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
