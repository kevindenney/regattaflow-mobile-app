Midline Starts
Unless there are strong reasons to push toward an end,
a midline start is the best choice (Fig. 11). The advantages

starting spot will depend on how the start plays out tactically.
Each section has many names.

compelling reasons to push toward an end.
include minimal crowding on the approach and strategic flex-
ibility once you clear the line. You can set up for your start
with a variety of approaches (details in the next section), and
you can often get a jump by avoiding midline sag .
Start Near the Favored End
When your choice is one of the ends, it is best to target
near—but not right at—the favored end. A favored end draws
a crowd, and you will get much more consistent starts by
staying out of crowds. Slide down the line just far enough to
clear the crowd, and you will have a much easier time getting
a good start. In fact, you may end up with the best start, as
the boats in the crowd deprive each other of the air and room
necessary to accelerate off the line.
Even when one or more boats do get good starts right at
the favored end, many more are buried. By hedging toward
the middle of the line, you dramatically increase the odds of
getting a good start.

Go Right!
If your goal is to start right and tack out immediately, it
may be worth it to go for a start right at the boat. If you get
the perfect start congratulations—and more power to you!
Even if you end up in the second row it's OK, since
you'll be tacking out. Sounds good—but in reality the front
row boats will be tacking immediately, and you will have to
delay your tack to avoid tacking in bad air. A position in the
front row a little bit down the line will allow you to sail full

## Conversion Checklist

- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
