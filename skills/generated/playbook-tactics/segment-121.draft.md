wind shifts forward, drive off. Use the favorable wind angle to
push down, below the rhumb line course (Fig. 5).
You should not head up one degree for each degree of
lift, nor should you drive off as many degrees as the wind
Fig. 4 - In a fading wind reach off fi rst if you
can still keep clear air. Head up later for a
faster reaching angle in the lighter wind.

course initially so you can head up later
with the lift.

initially and drive off as the wind moves
ahead.

lifts and off with the headers to keep more

reap big gains later in the leg, as you approach the mark with a
favorable wind angle.
In persistent shifts, as with oscillations, you must balance
the speed versus distance trade-offs to determine how far off
the rhumb line to sail.
Current
Current creates great strategic opportunity on reaches. The
first trick, of course, is to know what the current is going to do.
In this section we’ll take a look at strategy for current which
is consistent over the leg, and also for current which varies in
strength down the leg. For a discussion of current forecasting,
see Chapter 13: Weather later in this book.
Steady Current
When current strength and direction are consistent over
the length of the leg, the strategic goal is to correct for it by
steering a course which holds you on the rhumb line.
shifts forward. You must balance the extra speed with the extra
sailing distance to arrive at the optimum course and speed. A
change of course roughly half the angle of the shift seems a
good place to start.
Persistent Wind Shifts
In a persistent, gradual header, sail above the rhumb line
initially and let the shift push you down to the mark (Fig. 6).

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
