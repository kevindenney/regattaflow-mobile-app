## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Starts
Starts become increasingly critical. You must get off the
line with clear air and good speed. At the same, time starts be-
come increasingly difficult. It is easy to get lost in the crowd,
and easy to underestimate the effects of turbulence and bad air
on your approach.
You’ve got to push hard to keep clear air. A luffing start is
often the only way to stay in the front row. Once you fall into
bad air, you may never recover (Fig. 2).
Sailing off the line is a sprint to keep clear air. Just sail
fast. The tactician can watch to see how the breeze is settling
in, but it won’t matter if you aren’t in the front row.
Up The Beat
If you find yourself going the wrong way early, you’ll
have to wait until things open up during the first half of the
beat to remedy the problem.
As the fleet converges at the windward mark, the middle
of the course becomes a mess of boats, chop, and turbulence.
If you are not in the top ten, avoid the middle as you approach
the mark. Overstand to get well clear of the crowds. (The
trick, of course, is to arrive in the top ten rather than the middle
twenty. Life is tough in the rat race.)
Downwind
You must defend your air. If one boat rolls over you, ten
may go by before you recover. Work for inside position at
Gasp!

Fig. 3 - The fundamental distance racing strategy is to sail
toward the mark. One reason to modify fundamental strategy
is in order to sail fast. By sailing an angle slightly off the
rhumb line, we may be able to sail dramatically faster and be
closer to the fi nish line when the next weather change arrives.
extra distance you sail in a 100 mile race by sailing 5, 10, 15,
and 20° off course for half the distance to the finish, and then
aiming at the finish:
° Off Course 	Distance Sailed
0 	100 miles

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
