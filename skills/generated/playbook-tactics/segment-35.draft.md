## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

*Author's Note: We of course have never personally experienced any of
the troubles described here. This section is based entirely on observation
and hearsay, and may lack the veracity of the balance of our writing.
4.4 Pitfalls*
Sailboat races are won by the crew making the fewest
mistakes. Nowhere is this more true than around the start-
ing line. The most common mistake is being late for the start.
Much less common is being over early. Listed below are the
most common reasons for being late, and other assorted mis-
takes and pitfalls: Caught going the wrong way, son of caught
going the wrong way, too far from the line, too late, too early,
barging, can't fetch the pin, buried at the start, bad air, tunnel
vision, above a pincher, below a footer, and rules.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
