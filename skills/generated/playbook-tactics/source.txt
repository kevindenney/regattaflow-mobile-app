FORWARD
RegattaFlow Playbook. Racing Tactics is the most complete book on
racing tactics. As such, the book covers a broad spectrum of
topics, some of which you may find of more immediate inter-
est than others. While the material in later sections builds on
earlier chapters, each chapter is written to stand alone and can
be read independently.
The Racing Rules are covered as part of each chapter on
tactics. Those who are new to racing and the racing rules might
want to jump to the Appendix: Learning the Rules for a primer.
Speed Reading
If you are looking for an answer to a particular question,
you can skim quickly by reading the illustration captions and
studying the illustrations. When you hit upon an area of partic-
ular interest, dig into the text for more details. You can also use
this skimming technique for a quick review (Fig. 1).
Understanding the Illustrations
Most of the illustrations show the evolution of a tactical
situation over time. Generally the checkered boat is the object
boat discussed in the captions and text, with the black hulled
boat or dark sailed boat as the key adversary. Other boats of
varying shades and designs are used to fill out the scene.
A key to the symbols used to depict sequential action, the
path of a boat, and an alternative path, the wind, windshifts,
and current is shown on the following pages.

1.1 Tactics
This book covers sailboat racing tactics. T ACTICS in the
broad sense means strategy, tactics, and rules. Strategy is the
overall race plan. Strategy is based on wind, wind shifts, and
current. Strategy does not include other boats. Tactics are the
techniques used to implement strategy, to deal with other boats,
and to comply with the rules. While strategy involves a plan,
tactics are spontaneous. Rules are the International Sailing
Federation Racing Rules of Sailing and the Sailing Instructions
of a particular race. These are the rules of the game. You have
to follow the rules to play the game.
1.2 Why Do We Race Sailboats?
Of course, successful racing involves much more than
Tactics. Sailboat racing requires a broad mix of skills: There’s
tactics, and an understanding of wind and weather. We also
need sailing and boat handling skills, specialized sail trimming
skills, organizational skills to manage crew, and analytical
skills to grapple with information. We need to be able to set
goals and establish priorities, concentrate amidst chaos, ignore
discomfort, and learn from our mistakes.
None of us can master all the skills, and every race chal-
lenges us in new ways, for no two races are alike. Part of the
enduring appeal of racing is the breadth of the challenge it
provides.
The appeal of sailboat racing goes beyond these challeng-
es. We enjoy racing for the chance to be out on the water, for
the thrill of working with the wind, for the challenge of compe-
tition, and for the camaraderie racing brings.
1.3 The Racing Pyramid
The ingredients to racing success can be viewed in a pyra-
mid comprised of boat handling, boat speed, and tactics.
At the base of the pyramid is boat handling. You must
be able to sail your boat well before you can race well. Next is
boat speed. No matter what you race—cars, bicycles, horses,
bobsleds, whatever—speed is essential. Because sailors are not
always racing alongside their rivals, some underestimate the
importance of speed in sailboat racing.
Tactics lies at the top of the racing pyramid. To race suc-
cessfully you must work your way up the pyramid: Your boat
handling must be second nature and your boat speed second to
none. Tactics alone will rarely win races. Tactics just helps you
beat boats with comparable boat handling and boat speed.
In RegattaFlow Playbook. Racing Tactics we assume that your boat
handling and boat speed are competitive. For more on boat
handling and boat speed, refer to the companion volume,
RegattaFlow Playbook. Racing Trim, which is available (surprise!) from
RegattaFlowPlaybook.com, or your local chandler.
Before leaving this topic, one final point deserves men-
tion: The foundation of the racing pyramid is preparation.
It is difficult to sail well, and to sail fast, without a properly
equipped boat (Fig. 1).

1.4 Performance Analysis
So, how are your skills?
The Performance Analysis presented here is intended to
help you look at your racing skills and the overall skills of the
crew on the boat you race. If you are a tactical king, you need
to team up with a boat speed druid and a boat handling wizard.
Of course, if you race single handed you’ll need to be all these
things!
Consider both strengths and weaknesses. Obviously, you
want to eliminate weaknesses. As we shall see, there are also
ways to shape races toward your strengths.

2.1 Introduction
Many races are won or lost before they even start.
As boats head for the line some are ready to race and oth-
ers are not. In this chapter we will look at things to do during
the hour prior the start to get ready to race. Longer term prepa-
ration of the boat, crew, and equipment is covered in the com-
panion text, RegattaFlow Playbook. Racing Trim.
Every sailboat race is really several events in one. To suc-
ceed, you must understand the weather, harness the wind, and
battle against opponents. To win, you will need to be ready for
challenges of every type. You’ll also need to figure out which
are the critical variables for today’s race.
2.2 Get Ready to Race
On the Way Out…
Race Day preparation begins with a routine to insure that
everything needed is brought along and anything not needed is
left ashore. Once on board, the time spent getting to the course
area should be used to review any changes in technique or
organization from previous races. New crew should be paired
with regular crew and briefed on responsibilities. The boat
should be rigged and, if conditions permit, sailed to the course
area. Wind checks should be made periodically. Weather condi-
tions and any special strategic situations (season/ series stand-
ings) should be discussed.
Pre-Race Checklist:
1. 	Collect weather and wind information.
2. 	Test sail selection and trim upwind.
3. 	Record close-hauled course and speed on each tack.
4. 	Sail the compass course for each leg of the race in
sequence, noting wind speed and angle.
5. 	Tune up and test course sides with a tuning partner.
6. 	Set, jibe, jibe, jibe, and douse.
7. 	Plan sail selection and organize sails below decks.
8. 	Post start, course, and weather information.
9. 	Enter the marks of course into instrument system or
as GPS waypoints.
10. Formulate an overall race strategy.
11. Discuss the strategy and basis with entire crew. Em-
phasize expected conditions to look for and things
which might require a change in plans.
12. Check the starting line and plan starting strategy.
13. Set the prop and pump the bilge. Back down.
14. Review crew assignments; especially for new crew.
15. Locate any marks in sight.
16. Observe earlier fleets.
17. Get nervous & get used to it.
18. Get psyched—go team go!

At the Starting Area…
Plan to arrive at the starting area one full hour before the
race. During that hour you will have to plan strategy, make sail
selections, and tune up. A routine checklist of pre-race respon-
sibilities can make sure you touch all the bases. You can doubt-
less add to the list presented here.
One of the most valuable things you can do is to sail the
entire course in miniature. This means sail the compass course
of each leg in sequence. Here is what you will learn (Fig. 1):
• Are the windward legs balanced (with equal time on each
tack) or are they skewed?
• As with upwind legs, are the downwind legs square to
the wind, or are they unbalanced?
• If the course is a triangle or trapezoid, are the reaches
close or broad? This will help determine tactics at the
windward mark rounding and at the jibe mark. It will
also help the crew position the spinnaker pole properly
for initial trim.
• If the reach is a close reach, how much would the wind
have to shift to make the leg a jib reach?
Sailing the course in miniature will give your crew the big
picture, and allow them to plan ahead. The wind conditions are
likely to change over the course of the race. Sailing the course
in miniature will provide a base line to help you anticipate the
impact of those changes.
If time allows then sail the full course to get a feel for
geographic shifts and changes in conditions across the course.
Also, if gate marks are set, get a bearing on the gate to aid in
calculating the favored side of the gate.
Most of the information you need to gather prior to the
start can be compiled in a Race Planner, such as the one shown
in the next section. Of particular importance is the wind infor-
mation you compile.
Fig. 1 - By sailing the course in miniature - or the entire course
if time allows - you can anticipate the sailing conditions and
plan strategy for upcoming legs. If gate marks are set then get
the bearing of the gate line as you sail by.

2.3 The Race Planner
A standardized form, or Race Planner, can help you or-
ganize race information, and make sure you don’t forget any
details. A completed form is shown here. A sample blank is
shown on the following page. Copy it, refine it, and send me
ideas. You could be made famous in the next edition!
The form is divided into sections.
The Wind Graph
The purpose of the wind graph is to track the true wind
direction over time. We do this not by luffing into the wind, but
by recording our close-hauled compass course on each tack,
and then averaging those numbers. For example, if our close-
hauled course on starboard is 160°, while on port we sail 250°,
then the wind direction is 205°. (In this example we are tack-
ing through 90°, so on each tack we are sailing 45° off the true
wind.)
Note: There are several reasons to work from close-hauled
compass numbers rather then luffing into irons. For one, it al-
lows us to tune up in race trim while at the same time gathering
wind info. Second, luffing into irons beats up your sails; don’t
do it! Third, recent studies have shown that once the race starts,
luffing into irons is “tactically disadvantageous.” Since we’ll
be working from close-hauled compass numbers during the
race, we might as well get used to using close-hauled numbers
while we tune up.
How to Use It
During the hour prior to the start, and during the race,
we’ll record the time, wind speed, boat speed, and close-hauled
compass course. Record starboard tack numbers under the
Stbd heading, and port tack numbers under the Port heading.
We’ll then average those numbers to get the wind direction.
Here’s the Trick
After recording the initial starboard number, if the next
starboard number is to the right (higher) then record it on the
next line, shifted to the right. If the next starboard number is to
the left, then offset it to the left. Same for port, and ultimately,
for the wind itself. In this way we create a graphic representa-
tion of the wind trend.
Wind Graph Example
The example on the following page shows a sample plot.
Our initial port and starboard headings at 11:02 were 150° on
starboard, and 240° on port. This corresponds to a wind direc-
tion of 195°. Subsequent readings on starboard of are 150°,
160°, 155°, 165°, and so on. On port-tack the sequence is
240°, 245°, 250°, then 260°, and so on.
After we record port and starboard numbers we average
them and record a wind direction: 195° ,195° ,195° ,205° ,215°
,200° and so on in this example. After plotting wind direction
and offsetting the numbers right or left, we can connect a string
of readings into a graphic representation of the wind. This
graphic will help us see trends and anticipate subsequent shifts.
This example shows the wind oscillating back and forth,
and gradually shifting to the right - or so it seems.
Another Way
The process of plotting this information requires a lot of
time and attention. An alternative is to purchase, install, cali-
brate, and maintain a set of integrated true wind instruments
networked with a computer to record and display the informa-
tion. When working well, these systems are awesome.

Race Info
In this section, list critical race details. It will save you the
embarrassment of digging for the Race Book or Sailing Instruc-
tions as you watch everyone in your class start five minutes
early…
Course Info
List the distance and compass heading for each leg of the
course along with which sails you anticipate using.
Starting Line
Use this to plot the set up of the starting line, and by com-
paring that to the wind direction, you can determine which is
the upwind (favored) end of the line. In the example shown, the
right end of the line is 10° favored.
Weather Forecast
Essential meteorological data should be recorded here,
along with the marine forecast. This often provides an amusing
juxtaposition to the actual, observed weather.
The Back of the Planner
The back of the race planner should be used for post-race
comments. Immediately after the finish, review the race leg by
leg. Go over trim, tactics, and crew work; record new ideas.
List any equipment problems (and think through any excuses
you may need to explain away the race back at the bar). Con-
firm the schedule for the next practice (you do practice, don’t
you?) and race. Also print a diagram of your local race area on
the back of your race planner. The chart can then be used after
each race to record any local knowledge tricks you pick up
concerning wind or current.
Keep a Notebook
Compile your race planners in a notebook, so that you can
refer back to them over time. You may be surprised how often
conditions repeat themselves. Your race planners will serve as
the basis for developing and refining your local knowledge.
The ultimate value of this pre-race information will
become clear as we refer back to it during the race strategy
discussions which follow.

3.1 Introduction: Elements of Strategy
The start of a sailboat race is one of the most exciting
and demanding moments in sports. Starts require judgement,
timing, and teamwork. They require an understanding of
wind and weather, and knowledge of strategy, tactics, and
rules. Starts demand dexterity at close-quartered maneuver-
ing. Finally, starts require the ability to stay cool and con-
centrate in an environment packed with distractions. These
requirements create a uniquely thrilling, and at times baffling,
challenge.
Given so many areas of concern, our success will de-
pend on our ability to prioritize—to determine which factors
are critical to a particular start. The goal is to hit the starting
line at the gun at the favored end, with speed and clear air,
and freedom to maneuver at will.
The starting signal is but the midpoint of the start. A
good start is one which finds us in the front row, free and
clear, not just at the gun, but a or two minute later, after the
sprint off the line.
To succeed we must create order from the chaos of the
starting line. First we need a Starting Strategy—a game plan
based on the information gathered during our race prepara-
tion. Once we have a plan, then starting tactics will be used
to implement the plan. This chapter will look at starting
strategy—how to make a plan. The next chapter, on Starting
Tactics, will show us how to execute the plan.
The importance of a good start cannot be overstated.
While it is not necessary to win the start in order to win the
race, a good start is usually required. A good start gives the
freedom to pursue strategic objectives without interference
(Fig. 1). A poor start means compromising strategy and set-
ting off in the wrong direction, or sailing in bad air to pursue
strategic goals.
In this chapter we will concentrate on upwind starts.
Chapter 6 covers Offbeat Starts.
Fig. 1 - Starts are chaos. To succeed, we will fi rst need a
starting plan (strategy). Then we will need to execute the
plan (tactics) despite all the distractions. A good start is one
which fi nds us free to pursue our race strategy a minute or
two after the gun.

Chapter 3: Starting Strategy 	Page 15
If our race strategy says go left, then a start near the left
end is called for. The advantage here is not as strong as start-
ing right to go right. More critical than the exact position is
clear air, and the freedom to continue to the left unimpeded.
If there is no clear advantage to either side, then a
midline start is indicated. There are several advantages to
a midline start. From a starting perspective, it is often the
easiest and least crowded place to start. From a race strategy
perspective, a midline start gives the greatest flexibility, as it
offers the freedom to go either way. For further discussion of
Upwind Strategy, see Chapter 7.
Simply put: Start right to go right, start left to go left,
start in the middle to keep your options open (Fig. 2).
Fig. 3 - The upwind end of the line is favored, as it is closer
in sailing distance to the windward mark.
3.2 Where to Start
Starting strategy means deciding where on the line to
start. When deciding where to start, consider three factors:
1. Race Strategy for the First Leg.
2. The Set of the Line.
3. Making it Work.
Race Strategy will effect starting strategy, as we shall see.
The Set of the Line refers to the angle of the line to the wind.
In Making It Work we will look at balancing race strategy,
line set, and other concerns.
First Leg Strategy
Race Strategy for the first leg is the first factor to con-
sider in deciding where on the line to start.
If strategic considerations suggest sailing up the right
hand side of the beat, then a start at the right end of the line
is preferred. By starting at the right end we are free to tack
and go right immediately after starting. Clear air is relatively
unimportant, as we will be tacking away. Freedom to tack
and go right is the first priority.

Fig. 4 - To fi nd the favored end, compare the compass course
of the line to the wind direction. If the line is 90° from the
wind then the line is square. If the wind is less than 90° from
the line you are headed toward the favored end; greater than
90° and you are sailing away from the favored end.
end. Once you know the bearing of the line, you can
update your calculations as the wind changes. For
example, in the illustration, the line is set at 320°. If
the wind direction were 230° the line would be square
to the wind. With the wind at 240° the right end is
10° favored. With the wind at 220° the left end is 10°
favored (Fig. 4).
2. Luff into irons on the line (or off one end).
Sight across your boat (using the traveler bar, e.g..);
your sight will be square to the wind. While this is
a popular technique, I recommend against it for two
reasons: First, you must redo it every time the wind
shifts; second, it is hell on your sails—the worst thing
you can do to them (Fig. 5).
The Set of the Line
The set of the line means the angle of the line to the
wind. Since we are racing upwind, there is an advantage to
starting at the end which is furthest upwind—we call this
the favored end. A starting line set perpendicular to the wind
does not have a favored end. When the line is not square to
the wind then one end—the upwind end—is favored (Fig. 3).
Two questions come to mind:
Q1. How can you figure out which end is favored?
Q2. How much difference does it make?
Q1. Which End is Favored?
There are several ways to find the favored end of the
starting line. Some are better than others:
1. Compare the compass bearing of the line to the wind
direction. You can then plot which is the favored
Fig. 5 - You can determine the favored end–and ruin your
sails–by luffi ng into irons, either on the line or off one end.

3. Observe other starts. If the fleet lines up bow to bow
off the line, then the windward end is favored. If the
fleet lines up bow to stern, then the pin end is favored
(Fig. 6).
4. Sail past one end of the line close-hauled, and observe
the relative distance as you pass abeam of the other
end. This offers only a rough measurement.
No matter which technique (or combination) you use, you
must recheck the line if the wind shifts. The first technique is
preferred because it allows you to quickly recalculate after a
wind shift. It also allows you to determine how many degrees
off square the line is set, and the magnitude of the advantage,
as we shall see.
Fig. 6 - You can determine the favored end by observing
other starts. If the fl eet comes off the line bow to bow, the
right is favored; bow to stern, then the left is favored.
Right-Favored
Left-Favored
Fig. 7 - You need not start on port tack to take advantage of a
left end favored line. You will realize the advantage when you
tack.
Q2. How Much Difference Does It Make?
Two boats starting from opposite ends of a square line
will be equally far from an upwind mark. If they were on
converging tacks, they would hit bow to bow. If the line is
not square to the wind, then one will start ahead, as shown in
Figure 3.
You don't need to start on port tack to take advantage of
a pin-favored line. You will realize the advantage when you
tack to port (Fig. 7).
How Far Ahead?
For a line 5 degrees off square (most are), the advantage
is 12.5% of the distance between the boats. If the line is 10
degrees off square (not uncommon), the advantage is 25% of
the distance between the boats.

Fig. 8 - For a line that is 10° off square, the advantage
at the favored end is 25% of the length of the line—
That's 5 boat lengths on a line 20 lengths long!
Fig. 9 - The position of the windward mark does not determine
the favored end of the line. The set of the line relative to the
wind, not the mark, determines the favored end.
The position of the mark may be a factor in our first leg
strategy, and thus may impact our decision on where to start, but
it does not determine the favored end of the line. The favored
end is a function of wind direction—not mark position.
On a typical starting line, 20 boat lengths long, and 10°
off square, the advantage from end to end is 5 boat lengths!
A 5 length lead off the line is no small matter—clearly the
set of the line is an important factor in our decision where to
start (Fig. 8).
Mark Position and Favored End Not Related
Not so clear is the fact that the position of the windward
mark does not determine the favored end of the line. Boats
starting at the upwind end will be in the lead, and will be able
to cross boats starting from the downwind end and lead them
to the mark. Even though the downwind end may be closer
as the crow flies, it will be further in upwind sailing distance
(Fig. 9).

Making It Work
Where to start? In addition to our first leg strategy
and the set of the line, there are a collection of other factors
which we will lump under the heading of Making It Work.
Wind shifts, crowding, and clear air are among the issues we
must consider.
A start near the favored end, but clear of congestion, is
best. It provides the advantages of the favored end without
risking clear air and the freedom to maneuver and accelerate.
Remember—you don’t need to win the start the win the race;
you just need a good one. We'll look at a couple of situations
to get a feel for how to decide where to start.
Pick a Section
You don't so much pick a spot on the line as you pick a
section: left, middle, or right (Fig. 10).
Midline Starts
Unless there are strong reasons to push toward an end,
a midline start is the best choice (Fig. 11). The advantages
Fig. 10 - Pick a section of the line for your start. Your exact
starting spot will depend on how the start plays out tactically.
Each section has many names.
Fig. 11 - Midline starts are preferred if you do not have
compelling reasons to push toward an end.
include minimal crowding on the approach and strategic flex-
ibility once you clear the line. You can set up for your start
with a variety of approaches (details in the next section), and
you can often get a jump by avoiding midline sag .
Start Near the Favored End
When your choice is one of the ends, it is best to target
near—but not right at—the favored end. A favored end draws
a crowd, and you will get much more consistent starts by
staying out of crowds. Slide down the line just far enough to
clear the crowd, and you will have a much easier time getting
a good start. In fact, you may end up with the best start, as
the boats in the crowd deprive each other of the air and room
necessary to accelerate off the line.
Even when one or more boats do get good starts right at
the favored end, many more are buried. By hedging toward
the middle of the line, you dramatically increase the odds of
getting a good start.

Go Right!
If your goal is to start right and tack out immediately, it
may be worth it to go for a start right at the boat. If you get
the perfect start congratulations—and more power to you!
Even if you end up in the second row it's OK, since
you'll be tacking out. Sounds good—but in reality the front
row boats will be tacking immediately, and you will have to
delay your tack to avoid tacking in bad air. A position in the
front row a little bit down the line will allow you to sail full
speed until you do tack, and may actually allow you to tack
sooner! Plus, you avoid the hazards of barging (see Chapter
5: Starting Rules for more on barging), and of other crowd-
related problems (Fig. 12).
How badly do you need to be the first boat to tack out?
What are the odds of pulling it off? Can you afford the risk
of being buried? How does that compare with the much
higher percentage play of being the third boat to tack by start-
ing down the line?
Go Left!
If everything favors the left side, then get ready to
battle! There is little margin for error in these starts, and few
spaces in the front row when the pin end is favored. The
boat furthest left may be the only one with clear air, but any
hesitation may allow the next boat up the line to roll over the
top. Again, a start part way up the line may be the easiest way
to get the second best start (Fig. 13). You'll be able to create
space for clear air and room to accelerate. In fact, a jam up
at the pin may leave you with the best start! Plus you control
the center and the first tack. We'll look at the tactics of this
position in detail in the next chapter.
Hit the Shifts
The best start in shifty conditions is one which allows
you to sail to the shift with speed and affords you the room
to tack when the shift arrives. Blast off from the middle of
the line, tack if the next shift is coming from the right, and
sail fast. When racing to a shift, speed is more important
than pointing, and room to tack is critical if you are going to
take advantage of the shift when you get to it. Stay clear of
crowds and sail fast.
Fig. 12 - To go right, try a start just below
the crowd at the boat end. You can get
off the line with clear air and be a leader
going to the favored side.
Fig. 13 - To go left, a start with clear
air is essential—you can't tack out.
Once again, setting up just clear of
the crowd helps assure a good start.

Chapter 3: Starting Strategy 	Page 21
Reach Out and Back
The most commonly used approach is the Reach Out
and Back. Often the fleet moves én mass, reaching out on
port tack one and a half to two minutes before the start. At
around a minute everyone tacks back and reaches to the line,
trimming up to close-hauled for the last fifteen to thirty sec-
onds.
Advantages
The Reach Out and Back is simple.
Danger!
This approach creates clumps of boats. You want to
avoid crowds. This is also a barging set up. There are better
approaches.
The Secret to Success
The key is to hold a position with clear air in the front
row. Try to leave room for acceleration ahead and to leeward
by sweeping down and luffing up, effectively stalling while
those ahead sail further down the line. Then use the space
to accelerate. The biggest problem is keeping the space for
yourself. Some boats will try to go over and under you to
steal it; others will come in on port tack.
3.3 Approaches
The next step, after deciding where on the line to start,
is to decide how to get there. We must select our approach.
The approach we choose will form the basis of our starting
plan. There are a variety of approaches available, each with
advantages and disadvantages. It is best to be well-versed and
comfortable with each, so we can select the one which best
fits the prevailing strategic and tactical circumstances.
The approaches covered in the following pages include:
• Reach Out and Back
• Half Speed Approach
• Vanderbilt Start
• Triangle Approach
• Port Tack Approach / Pin End Start
• Port Tack Approach / Midline Start
• Port Tack Start
• Luffi ng Start
• Elvstrom Start
• Dip Start

Page 22 	RegattaFlow Playbook. Racing Tactics
Another problem with the half speed approach is that
you must sail on port tack into oncoming starboard boats and
find room to make a full 180° turn.
The Secret to Success
In order to be able to accelerate readily to full speed it
is important to maintain at least half speed throughout the
approach. Another trick to knowing when to "pull the trig-
ger" and accelerate to full speed. Truth is, time, speed, and
distance judgement is the secret to success in most starts, not
just this approach.
In big fleets there is rarely sufficient room to be fully ac-
celerated at the gun. The key is to hold a position with clear
air in the front row. Boats tend to push to the line early to
keep clear air. While you might prefer to hang back to leave
room to accelerate, you have to stay in the front row to keep
clear air.
The Half Speed Approach shares the basic out-and-back
geometry of the Vanderbilt Start (coming up next), but has
some distinct advantages.
Half Speed Approach
The Half Speed Approach is popular and effective. Sail
away from a spot on the line and turn back early to allow for
the congestion and bad air of the fleet. Once headed for the
line, speed is adjusted to properly time the approach. The ob-
ject is to approach at half speed with final trim coming early
enough to reach full speed and hit the line at the gun.
Advantages
The half speed approach is relatively simple and reli-
able–a good choice in moderate to heavy air. It gets you set
up early and puts you in the front row. This approach is effec-
tive in any part of the line. For a right-hand end start, you can
bottle up the crowd reaching in above you.
Danger!
Tacking kills speed. Jibing carries you away from the
line. Allow plenty of time for your turn. At the same time,
beware setting up too close to the line, without room to accel-
erate. Also, avoid this approach in light air, or in a heavy boat
which is slow to build speed.

Vanderbilt Start
The Vanderbilt Start is a popular but flawed approach.
The basic plan is to sail away from the line on a port tack
broad reach on the reciprocal of your starboard tack close-
hauled course. You then tack or jibe, and return to the place
from which you departed.
Advantages
The attraction of this approach is its simplicity.
Danger!
The problem? It doesn't work. At least not in a competi-
tive fleet it doesn't, as it lacks flexibility. If anything throws
off your timing, you will be late.
One flaw is that you cannot make your turn at the ap-
pointed place and time because other boats will be there. If
you somehow find room for your turn, you will lack the clear
air necessary to accelerate; and the crowds will block your
path.
The Secret to Success
In a small, uncompetitive fleet you might succeed with
this start, but you would do better to practice a technique
(like the Half Speed Approach) which will be of more use
when you move up.
If you insist on using this approach, remember that the
speeds out and back are not necessarily equal, and you must
allow sufficient time for your tack or jibe. The Vanderbilt
start was developed for big boat match racing. Congestion
and disturbed air make it a poor choice for fleet racing.
Triangle Approach
The Triangle Approach avoids
the problem of searching for room to tack or jibe in a
crowd. Initiate the triangle at the spot from which you want
to start. Sail from your starting spot on a port beam reach,
along the line and its extension. Next, jibe to a starboard
broad reach and sail down to the final approach layline. Fi-
nally, head up to close-hauled for the run at the line. Each leg
of the triangle is of about the same duration–usually 30 to 45
seconds each for a 30-foot boat, scaled up or down for larger
or smaller boats.
Advantages
The turn onto your final approach doesn't slow you
down and doesn't take much room. You are also very maneu-
verable as you reach in. The triangle approach allows more
room to accelerate than other approaches and provides flex-
ible timing in variable conditions. Recommended for light to
moderate air. Works anywhere on the line.
Danger!
Don't be late. If you are late, you may not have time to
get through the crowd and around the bargers.
The Secret to Success
If you fear you are running late on leg two, cut the cor-
ner. Often legs two and three turn into one long continuous
sweeping turn.

Port Tack Approach for a Pin End Start
From the starting pin, sail up the line on port tack,
toward the fleet. As you near the pack of starboard tack boats
working down the line, tack to leeward of the crowd and lead
them back toward the pin.
Advantages
A port tack approach allows you to set up late and is the
easiest way to judge the timing for a pin end start.
Danger!
Where do we begin? There are the obvious port-star-
board and tacking-too-close risks, the risk of not finding a
space to tack into, and the need to tack and accelerate late in
the sequence. This can be particularly difficult in light air.
The Secret to Success
This is an excellent set up for a pin end start. Note the
time as you sail past the pin, and keep track of the split time
as you sail up the line. It may be necessary to duck some
early starboard tackers and then jump into the next gap.
Obviously, good crew work is essential to a smooth tack and
quick acceleration. Your approach should set up three to four
boat lengths from the line. Also, to carry speed into the tack,
head up and trim on port before tacking to starboard.
Port Tack Approach for a Midline Start
As with the pin end start, come in from the left end of
the line about three boat lengths below the line. As you near
the pack of starboard tack boats, duck the early bunches and
tack into a gap.
Advantages
A port tack approach allows you to set up late and avoid
clumps of boats which have set up early. It protects you from
attack, and allows you to attack others if you choose.
Danger!
As with the Port Approach for a Pin End Start, there are
right-of-way hazards and the challenge of tacking and accel-
erating late in the sequence.
The Secret to Success
This is a great set up for a midline start. Your tactician
should be looking ahead to find a gap. Once you find a gap,
the key is to tack into the windward edge, leaving room to
drive off to leeward and accelerate. Allow plenty of time to
search out a gap, tack, and get up to speed. Again, good crew
work is essential to a smooth tack and quick acceleration.

Port Tack Start
Approach the line on port tack, shoot through a gap,
and cross the fleet. This approach requires great timing and
nerves of steel.
Advantages
If the line is port end favored and the right-hand side of
the course is advantaged, a port tack start lets you blast off
toward the favored side.
Danger!
Are you Crazy? Poor timing or unsteady nerves can
lead to disaster. Other boats doing the same thing can make it
messy.
The Secret to Success
Timing, anticipation, and a bail out plan. It is always
better to duck boats – even if you duck the entire fleet – than
to slam in a last second tack. Look ahead as the fleet sets up
and pick your gap. Close reach with lots of speed and trim
into your gap. Be ready to search for a new gap on a mo-
ments notice. An adverse current can hold up the fleet and
make it easier to succeed with this approach. (It has also been
suggested that this approach be reserved for times when you
are sailing someone else's boat.)
Luffing Start
Select a spot and luff near the line. Trim for speed in the
final seconds before the gun. The object is to secure a spot on
the line.
Advantages
In a crowded fleet on a short line, this is one way to
secure a spot in the front row.
Danger!
The dangers are not leaving enough room to accelerate,
and having other boats sail over and under you before you
can respond; or being too far back and falling into bad air.
The Secret to Success
Preserve as much space as possible ahead and to lee-
ward, while preserving clear air and holding your space in the
front row. You'll need this room to accelerate.
This approach is popular in dinghies, centerboard boats
and some one-design keelboats, particularly in large fleets
where it is difficult to find room on the line. It is not practical
for any but the lightest keelboats. If your boat is relatively
light in a mixed fleet, set up to leeward of the crowd, luff
everyone, and then blast off while others wallow.
Lufing boats tend to drift to leeward. Fore-reaching
– holding close-hauled trim while sailing above close-hauled
– is an effective way to minimize leeway and create acclera-
tion room to leeward.

Elvstrom Start
This is an approach I observed Paul Elvstrom using in
shifty conditions. He positioned himself to leeward of the
R.C. Boat and luffed on the starboard tack layline. If the
last shift before the start was a lift, he sailed it to start at the
favored boat end of the line; if the last shift was header, he
sailed it to the favored pin end.
Advantages
In shifty conditions, this approach allows a last minute
decision based on the final shift before the gun.
Danger!
Timing is tricky. Be sure to allow enough time to get to
the line in a header—and be sure you will be able to fetch.
The Secret to Success
The beauty is that while the rest of us luffed on the line
and battled to hit the first shift after the start, Elvstrom was a
step ahead, hitting the last shift before the start.
Dip Start
Approaching from the wrong side of the line, find a gap
and dip into it from above.
Advantages
When the line is difficult to approach from below due to
light wind and strong current, you drop into a front row seat.
This approach is useful only when the line is difficult to ap-
proach in the conventional way.
Danger!
The danger of being over early or of being luffed by lee-
ward boats limits the usefulness of this approach. Also illegal
if the One Minute Rule is invoked.
The Secret to Success
The Dip Start can succeed in light air and adverse cur-
rent. A large R.C. boat with the line site near the bow increas-
es the chances of success, as does a pin favored line.
3.4 Conclusion
Starting strategy is a game of choices, requiring a bal-
ance between overall strategic goals, line set, and crowding.
Once the strategic decision has been made on where to start,
we must select an approach appropriate to the conditions.
This strategic plan lays the groundwork for our start.

C HAPTER 4: S TARTING T ACTICS
4.1 Introduction
With our strategic plan set, Starting Tactics will be used to
execute a start which meets our strategic goals. Our goal is to
arrive at the selected section of the line at the gun at full speed
with clear air and no interference from other competitors. No
mean feat ( Fig. 1).
This chapter will look first at the tactical information we
need and how to gather it. Next, we will look at the start it-
self—those final fractions of a minute which can unravel the
best laid plan. This section includes the final approach, the
critical sprint off the line, and some common pitfalls.
4.2 Tactical Information
We gather tactical information (Fig. 2) about the line to
help us execute our approach. This is different from the stra-
tegic information we gathered to decide where on the line to
start.
The information we need includes:
The timed sailing length of the starting line (Fig. 2a).
This information will help us judge our timing as we set
up for our start and as we make our final run at the line.
It can also help us figure out if other boats are close
enough to pose a threat to our plans.
Laylines to each end of the line (Fig. 2b,c).
Knowing the layline to each end, particularly if you
plan to start near the end, will help you set up. Obvious-
ly, you want to be inside the right end layline to avoid
barging, and inside the left layline to fetch. But you also
can use the layline to position yourself up or down the
line. For example, if you want to start five boat lengths

after crossing the layline, not five lengths after passing
under the end of the line.

Line sights to each end of the line can help us judge
how close to the line we are. This is particularly use-
ful for midline starts or when other boats obstruct our

way to judge the line, as it is not practical to sight the

the chaos around you. Appoint a spokesman to handle
inter-boat "dialogue."
Fig. 3 - The Practice Start: Whichever approach you choose,
do a practice run to prepare for the real start.
4.3 The Start
Regardless of the approach we choose, the details of tim-
ing, speed, and clear air can be a struggle. Our approach gets us
set up. We have taxied into place. Next is our sprint down the
runway and the climb out.
The Practice Start
A practice start helps assure success. A dress rehearsal of
our planned approach (Fig. 3) lets us:
1. Confirm lines of sight and bearings on the line.
2. Check laylines.
3. Confirm wind direction and close hauled headings.
4. Approximate timing for the final approach.
5. Check sail trim for acceleration off the line.
6. Confirm crew organization and communications.
A practice start is an important part of preparing for our
final approach. Obviously, it lacks some of the frenzy of the
real thing, but it offers a valuable base line.
I often us the three minute signal for our practice start.
The Final Approach
Our goal is to hit the line at the gun, with full speed, clear
air, and no interference from other boats. Here are some things
you can do to accomplish this: Sail your boat, create room,
control speed, kill time, keep clear air, accelerate, sail faster
than full speed, defend your space, start near a marshmallow,
call the line, call time, speed and distance, and get off the line.
1. Sail Your Boat
On the final approach you must charge the line. This is
no place for the timid. Push hard to hit the line with full speed
at the gun. Don’t hold back. With the practice run under your
belt, you should be able to communicate easily with the crew
and concentrate on speed and timing. Do not let the histrionics
on boats nearby distract you. Appoint a “spokesman” to handle
boat-to-boat “conversation.” If the tactician, helmsman, and
sail trimmers sail the boat, you will leave the chaos in your
wake (Fig. 4).

Fig. 6 - To control speed luff the jib fi rst.
This keeps the bow up and helps create
room. Or fore-reach, sailing above close-
hauled with close-hauled trim.
Remember that it takes a long time to trim a genoa—call
for trim early so you have full trim when you need it. Time
your approach so you hit the line at full speed. Trimming at the
gun is too late.
4. To Kill Time
Rather than slow down, a better way to burn off extra time
is by over-steering and sailing extra distance (Fig. 7). Keep
your speed. Steering erratically will keep others away, preserv-
ing space and clear air. (My crew tell me I'm great at over-
steering!)
5. To Keep Clear Air
Near the line it is important to keep clear air. You want to
keep your bow even with those around you. If you fall into bad
air, it is difficult to accelerate. At the same time, you want to
hold back with room to accelerate to the line. Boats which are
too close to the line will not have room to accelerate without
There are several techniques you can use during the final
approach which will help you start with speed.
2. To Create Room
Perhaps the single most important thing you can do on the
final approach is create a double space to leeward. You then
use part of this space to drive off and accelerate to full speed.
Your goal is to save part of the space for after the start, so you
won't have any interference from leeward. By carving a double
space, you can accelerate more quickly and avoid the danger
of sailing down into bad air. You create room by pinching up
under boats to windward (Fig. 5).
3. To Control Speed
If you need to slow down during your approach, luff the
jib first and keep the main trimmed. This creates weather helm,
holding the bow up and preserving space to leeward (Fig. 6).

Then drive off to accelerate.

erate. You may end up backwinded by boats close to leeward,
or blanketed by boats driving over on top of you. If you have a
good double space you can start with full speed and keep clear
air off the line. In fact it may be possible to start going faster
than full speed.
7. Faster than Full Speed?
Full speed is passé. Our goal is to hit the starting line at
faster than full speed. But how?
If you have room to leeward to drive down the line you
can accelerate on a close reach to speeds faster than close-
hauled. When you trim up to course you will carry the extra
speed for a few boat lengths—enough to squirt you out in front
of the pack as you come off the line (Fig. 10). We won’t settle
for full speed anymore—we want to come off the line faster
than full speed!!
being over early; boats which are too far back will be in bad
air. This is a difficult balance to strike (Fig. 8).
The more room you can preserve in front of you for ac-
celeration the easier it will be to preserve space to leeward,
which you can use later if needed. If you use up your forward
space, you will be forced to drive down and give up some of
your cushion to leeward. You may even be driven down into
the exhaust of the boat to leeward.
6. To Accelerate
To accelerate from half speed, bear off a few degrees from
close-hauled. Trim the jib first to drive the bow down, then
trim the main. If the main comes in too early it creates weather
helm, making it difficult to bear off and accelerate. It also may
push the bow up and over early. Trim the jib to accelerate, trim
the main to squeeze up to course as speed builds (Fig. 9).
Setting up with a space to leeward helps insure a good
start. Without the space to drive off it will be difficult to accel-

8. To Defend your Space
Once you are set up with a space to leeward, you may
have to defend it from those who would steal it away. This may
happen while you are killing time, luffing, before you make
your final mad dash to the line. Suppose you see a port tack
boat sailing down the line, eyeing your space; or you see a star-
board tacker ducking sterns, looking for a space to cut in. How
can you defend you position? With sails luffing, turn your bow
down and stretch your boat across your space. Unless the space
is huge (big enough for two), this should scare off the treasure
hunters. The port-tack boat should continue down the line;
while the starboard tacker may take the space to windward,
rather than leeward. Once the threat has passed, trim the main
hard and put the helm over to bring your bow up. You may let
your neighbor to windward off the hook with this move, but
you should be able to save your space (Fig. 11a,b).
If you have already started to build speed on your final
dash, then don't worry about others sailing into your space. The
port tacker won't be able to tack and accelerate into your spot
before you drive over him, and the starboard boat won't be able
to drive through you far enough to be a threat. As you trim up,
you will gas him.
Another way you can protect your territory is with sweep-
ing turns up and down. This is an effective way to kill time and
preserve your space.
9. Start Near a Marshmallow
Another useful technique is to find a “marshmallow”
to set up nearby ( Fig.12). If you can surround yourself with
slow boats, you will be assured of less interference coming off
the line. (Kinda’ makes you wonder about all those times you
found yourself near the fleet champion at starts last season,
don’t it?)

10. Call the Line
A crew member in the bow pulpit should signal informa-
tion about other boats and distance to the line. Point at other
boats with fingers, and hold fingers up to give boat lengths to
the line. Signal where to go with a thumb: up to accelerate,
down to slow, windward to head up, and leeward to bear off.
The bow crew needs a watch to call the start effectively. As
soon as she (or he) knows you will be clear, she/he should get
off the bow (Fig. 13).
11. Calling Time, Speed, and Distance
Calling starts is tricky—you need to know when to put the
hammer down. Too early, and you'll be over, or you'll have to
stall at the last moment; too late and you'll be buried by those
around you. At every moment during the sequence you should
know how far from the line you are (Fig. 14). As you sail away
this includes time for a turn.
It isn't easy, but with practice you will find you are able to
guess time to the line quite accurately. It is an important skill.
12. Getting Off the Line
The starting signal marks the midpoint of the start. We've
dashed down the runway—now for the climb out. The final
seconds before the start, and the two minutes after, are often a
pure sprint for clear air. Speed is the key ingredient. A little ex-
tra speed or pointing here translates into a big advantage. Make
sure you are tuned up before the start; concentrate on sailing
your boat; ignore others. Try to start faster than full speed if
possible, and blast off. Settle the crew and concentrate on steer-
ing and trim.
The tactician should watch the compass and the fleet for
shifts and room to tack. Being a shade slow or a little low even-
tually leads to bad air, and problems multiply. Keep clear air
and keep moving. Nothing else matters (Fig. 15).

*Author's Note: We of course have never personally experienced any of
the troubles described here. This section is based entirely on observation
and hearsay, and may lack the veracity of the balance of our writing.
4.4 Pitfalls*
Sailboat races are won by the crew making the fewest
mistakes. Nowhere is this more true than around the start-
ing line. The most common mistake is being late for the start.
Much less common is being over early. Listed below are the
most common reasons for being late, and other assorted mis-
takes and pitfalls: Caught going the wrong way, son of caught
going the wrong way, too far from the line, too late, too early,
barging, can't fetch the pin, buried at the start, bad air, tunnel
vision, above a pincher, below a footer, and rules.
1. Caught Going the Wrong Way
You're reaching down the line on port tack, looking for a
place to turn around. As the pack gathers for a run at the line
it can be impossible to find room to turn in the crowd. To keep
clear air, look ahead and turn before you get into the crowd.
Otherwise, by the time you emerge from the other end and get
turned back you will be late, and behind everyone. Turn back
early. Point your bow toward the line (Fig. 16).
Fig. 17 - Don't duck boats if you aren't
sure you have plenty of time to come out
the other side.
2. Son of Caught Going the Wrong Way
This happens on starboard tack. Ducking sterns of other
starboard tack boats stalling ahead. Once you start to duck you
may never emerge. It is safer to keep your bow headed for the
line. Don’t duck unless you are sure you have plenty of time to
come out on the other end (Fig. 17).
3. No Vacancy
You are on a port tack approach, the third of three boats
reaching up the line, searching for gaps in the crowd. Count
the gaps ahead – if there are only two spaces (or fewer) remain-
ing, then turn back early. Don't continue up the line if there
aren't as many spaces as boats in the hunt. (Fig. 18).

crowd going the wrong way.

boats to the available spaces - and turn back
early if there are no vacancies.

Page 36 	RegattaFlow Playbook. Racing Tactics
4. Squeeze
If you are the lead boat on a port tack approach then
beware the trailing boat tacking when you do, and putting you
in the squeeze. Over turn on your tack to force the trailing boat
to spin its tack, and then trim up hard to open a gap. (Fig. 19).
5. Too Far from the Line
When the fleet gets between you and the line there is no
way to get through, and you get only bad air. In most condi-
tions it pays to stay within a few lengths of the line. In light air
or adverse current stay right on the line. It is easy to get pushed
away and hard to get back (Fig. 20a).
6. Too Late
You approach too late, get bad air, and can never acceler-
ate. Has this ever happened to you? Me neither.
Once, when I was stuck in a streak of late starts I adjusted
my timing to try to be five seconds early. It is easier to kill time
than to recreate it. Set yourself up to be a few seconds early
(Fig. 20b). Don't be late!
7. Arrive Too Early
You either end up over early, or you stall and start with
no speed and get run over. Timing is tricky–close enough to
control part of the line, but far enough back to have room to
accelerate (Fig. 20c).
8. Barging
Stay below the layline to the windward end. Any time
your final approach is from above the layline, you are asking
for trouble (Fig. 21b). Barging is reviewed in Chapter 5: Start-
ing Rules.
9. Can’t Fetch the Pin
When you find yourself outside the layline to the pin, bail
out. At the first sign of trouble jibe around. Tacking to port is
suicide. You may be able to come away with a decent start,
instead of being wrapped around the pin as the gun fires. For a
pin-end approach, you must know the layline and stay above it
(Fig. 21a).

If you'd like to tack out, watch out for boats inside you
preparing to do the same. Try to spare yourself the utter frus-
tration of being tacked on just as you try to clear your air.
The tactician should have a contingency plan in mind in
the event of a bad start. Think about it before it happens, then
see to it that it doesn't.
12. Tunnel Vision
You hit the line right on time and get so excited you over
steer and over trim and pinch and . . .
Over-trimming at starts is very common. All that energy
and excitement—plus you are trying to squeeze every last bit
of performance out of the boat. Until you are at full speed in
clear air and open water, over-trimming squeezes the life out of
your performance instead.

10. Buried at the Start
“Everything seemed fine, then we trimmed to go and noth-
ing happened. We shot out the back of that fleet so fast you’d
think we came out of a cannon.” If you're off the pace by one
instant, those around you get the jump.
Sails don’t come in instantaneously. From the thought "I
need speed" to the reality takes 5 steps: Thought, Call, Trim,
Accelerate, Speed. Call for trim before you need it (Fig. 22a).
11. Starting in Bad Air
Coming off the line in bad air requires a quick evaluation
of options. Can we tack? Can we squeeze up or drive off into
clear air? It can take minutes before things open up and you
have a chance to clear out. If you are unsure what to do, con-
sider your overall strategy. If you want to go right then it may
be worth ducking a few sterns to get out that way. If you are
on the favored tack or if you are headed for the favored side, it
may be worth eating bad air for a short while—though it will
seem an eternity (Fig. 22b).

13. Start above a Pincher
You come off the line fine, but the guy below you sticks
his boat up and pinches. He is slow, but just fast enough to
sneak under you and give you bad air. As he ruins your start it
is little consolation that he is hurting himself too (Fig. 23a).
14. Start below a Footer
This can be a problem, or a blessing. If we are inspired to
new heights of performance in order to hold off the speedster,
this can work to our advantage. If the speedster rolls over the
top of us then, we have a problem (Fig. 23b).
15. Rules
In addition to the regular racing rules, there are some
special rules which apply only at starts. Know the rules, and be
aware that others may not.
Starting rules are such an important topic that they deserve
a chapter all their own, which is next.
Fig. 24 - Starts require a good plan, great teamwork, and
impeccable timing.
Fig. 23 - A pincher (a) below you can ruin your start—and his
own. Try to gas off a footer (b) before the speedster rolls over
you. Sometimes you have to beat pinchers and footers at their
own game before you can sail your boat properly.
4.5 Conclusion
Starting Tactics guides us through the most important and
exciting part of sailboat racing. It is no wonder more and more
regattas are being run on short courses, with multiple races
each day: Everyone wants more chances to start.
Starts take teamwork built around a sound, flexible plan
directed toward clear strategic goals. Get the information you
need, practice your approach, and don't be late (Fig. 24).

Chapter 4: Starting Tactics 	Page 39
4.6 - Building Starting Skills
Stop and Go Drill
Park your boat (near a buoy) on a close-hauled course with
sails luffi ng, then trim and accelerate to full speed. (How
long – in time and distance – did it take to reach full speed?)
Experiment to fi nd the best angle and trim sequence (jib before
main, but by how much) for different wind and sea conditions.
Work on the stopping part too. Have crew push out on the
boom to create an air brake. You may need this someday when
you're headed for a gap which closes up in front on you - and
you'll need an alert word to call for it: "Air Brake!"
Fore Reaching
Fore Reaching is a way to park and hold position and slow
down without luffi ng. With sails trimmed close-hauled, head
up above close-hauled, but not into irons. The jib will go soft,
but not backwind – sort of a super pinch mode. Great for
holding height and slowing down at the same time.
The jib trimmer should be ready – with the sheet in hand – to
luff the jib if it starts to back. Otherwise you may be thrown
into an inadvertent tack!
To accelerate out of fore reaching bear off to close hauled or
just below and ease the sheets a few inches.
Add Timing
Using a short (fi ve minute) starting cycle, repeat your stop and
go or fore reaching drill with the goal of passing a buoy at full
speed at the gun. Luff or park far enough from the buoy to have
room to get up to full speed. How long does it take (in time and
distance)?
Circle back and do it again every fi ve minutes.
Time / Speed / Distance
How long will it take us to get to the line from here? You will
be practicing this in the timing drill above. Do it everywhere
you go—in and out of the harbor, as you approach a buoy or
crab pot or another boat. With a little practice you can refi ne
this all-important starting skill.
Don’t be late
If you are habitually late for starts, build in an extra fi ve or ten
seconds into the sequence. That is, plan to start fi ve seconds
early. It is much easier to waste time than it is to retrieve time
that is lost when you are late. (You’ve noticed that too, I bet.)
Rotate Positions
During practice, rotate crew positions to get an idea of what
each crew member is doing. How hard is it to grind in the jib?
How tricky is it to call the line (much less stay on board) when
working the point on a wavy day?
Watch Other Starts
Try a position off the pin end to see how other fl eets sag and
accelerate. Try watching from behind the line to see how others
approach and create room to accelerate. Rather than try to
watch the entire fl eet, focus your attention on one or two boats
for the last minute or two of the sequence.
Practice Partner
Adding just one more boat can make all the difference. Set a
short (2 length) line and practice starts.

C HAPTER 5: S TARTING R ULES
Starting Rules are a mix of the regular racing rules—
such as starboard / port, overtaking, and While Tacking—
which always apply; and special rules which apply only
during starts (Fig. 1). These special rules include exemption
from the Mark Room and Obstruction Rules (Section C
preamble), restarting (Rules 21.1 & 29.1), and the one minute
rule (Rule 30.1). The luffing rules are now the same before
starts as they are during the race though in practice some dif-
ferences remain as we shall see.
If you'd like an overview of the rules and their underly-
ing principles, jump to Chapter 12 - Learning the Rules.
5.1 Luffing at Starts
As written, the luffing rules are the same before starts as
they are during the race. In practice there are differences, as
there is no proper course before the start.
Here is how the luffing rules work (Fig. 2):
The leeward boat has right of way (Rule 11) and may
luff as she pleases, limited only by the need to give the wind-
ward boat room to keep clear (Rule 16).
If the leeward boat established her overlap from astern,
then after the starting signal, she shall not sail above her
proper course (Rule 17).
If the windward boat established an overlap from astern,
or if the leeward boat tacked into the overlap, then she may
luff and she may sail above her proper course even after the
starting signal. (Why she would want to is another question.)
When you find yourself as a windward boat in a luffing
situation, the definition of keep clear requires that you re-
spond promptly to a luff. Head up as far and as fast as possi-
ble or necessary. Failure to respond to a luff will likely result
Fig. 1 - Starting Rules are a mix of regular racing rules and
special rules which apply only at starts.
Definitions:
The definitions in the Racing Rules of Sailing can clarify
some common confusion and misunderstanding of the rules.
Proper Course is the course a boat would sail to finish as
quickly as possible in the absence of the other boats referred to.
Note that A boat has no proper course before her starting signal.
One boat keeps clear of another if the other can sail her
course with no need to take avoiding action and, when overlapped
on the same tack, if the leeward boat could change course without
immediately making contact with the windward boat.
Room is the space a boat needs in the existing conditions
while maneuvering promptly in a seamanlike way.
in disqualification.
A leeward boat may luff to clear the pin as long as she
allows the windward boat room to keep clear. Even after the
starting signal, a leeward boat may luff above close hauled,
as starting is her proper course.

Since L established her overlap from astern, she must as-

Sequence 2: L may luff as high as she likes – provided she
gives W room to keep clear – before and after the gun.
Sequence 3: After tacking into the overlap, L may luff as high
as she likes – provided she gives W room to keep clear.

Scenario 1 – A leeward boat sailing close-hauled may close out
a windward / inside boat at the start..
5.2 Barging
A leeward boat need not give an inside boat room when
approaching the line to start, as the Mark Room rules do not
apply (Section C Preamble).. (An inside boat is entitled to
room when the fleet is noodling around before the start.)
The windward / leeward rule (Rule 11) applies. It is con-
strained only by the need to leave room for the windward boat
to keep clear (Rule 16).
If the overlap was established from clear astern, then
the leeward boat is further restricted to not sail above proper
course after the starting signal (Rule 17). (By definition there
is no proper course prior to the starting signal.)
If L's turn to proper course creates room for W to start (as
in Scenario. 4, at right) that is W's good fortune; but if L's turn
to proper course leaves no room for W then W is NOT entitled
to room (see Scenario 5)
The anti-barging rule is detailed in the situations presented
on this and the facing page.
Confused? Here's a tip: Don't barge.
Scenario 2 – Likewise, a leeward boat sailing a reach may peel
off a windward / inside boat at the start..
Scenario 3 - A leeward boat may sail above close hauled to
close out a windward boat at a start. Even after the starting
signal the leeward boat can sail above close-hauled except…

As mentioned above, the starboard/port, overtaking, and
tacking-too-close rules apply during starts just as they do on
the course. In starboard/port (Rule 10) situations the starboard
boat may do as she pleases, constrained only by the need to
leave port a way to keep clear (Rule 16, Fig. 4b).
The starting rules are intended to bring order to a crowded
starting line. They are fairly effective, at least for upwind starts.
Offwind starts create a whole new set of tactical concerns and
rules dilemmas, as we will see in the next chapter.
5.3 Other Starting Rules
If you hit a starting mark you may exonerate yourself by
doing an immediate One-Turn Penalty (Rule 31, Fig. 3a ).
A boat which is over early must restart by returning to the
proper side of the line (Definition of Start). The Race Commit-
tee must fly code flag X (white field with blue "+") if a boat
or boats is over early (Rule 29.1) but is not required to hail
individual boats — you must judge for yourself whether or not
you have started properly. . While returning to restart, you must
stay clear of those who have started properly (Rule 21.1, Fig.
3b).
The one minute rule is in effect when code flag “I” (a
yellow field with a black "eye") is displayed as the preparatory
signal four minutes before the start. You may not cross the line
from the wrong direction after the one minute signal. A dip
start or dip restart is not allowed. You must clear yourself by
sailing around the end of the line (Rule 30.1, Fig. 4a).

If the mark is not positioned downwind then clear air is
available only at one end. Approach with the right of way and
expect a crowd. It can get ugly.
6.2 Reaching Starts
Tactics on reaching starts depend on the exact wind
angle of the line and to the mark.
Wind Forward of the Beam
The fleet will tend to bunch up at the upwind end, often
without reason. As long as the wind is forward of the beam,
a start near the leeward end is often better. You can reach up
in front of the crowd, and off in puffs. That is, if the puffs
get to you. The danger is that boats above you will get the
C HAPTER 6: OFFBEAT S TARTS
While reaching and running starts are far less common
than upwind starts, the keys to success are familiar: Planning,
timing, and judgement are critical as always. Offwind starts
lack some of the order of upwind starts; they can be unpre-
dictable, and some of the techniques differ from those we use
upwind. Below are a few thoughts on starts in a variety of wind
angles, from straight downwind to reaches and one-legged
beats.
6.1 Running Starts
As chaotic as upwind starts are, they pale by comparison
to running starts. Starting near the ends enables you to reach
out to the side for clear air, but you are then committed to that
side for the first part of the race. Starting in the middle of the
line leaves you in bad air. Pick a side which will give you clear
air, and try to anticipate crowds and wind shadows (Fig. 1).
One of the most common mistakes in downwind starts
is delaying the spinnaker set. To hit the line at full speed you
must have your spinnaker up and drawing on your approach.
Hoist your spinnaker in stops (rubber bands or thin yarn).
Break it out and trim for full speed as early as you can—thirty
seconds to one minute before the start—to get a jump on those
who wait for the gun before hoisting. As a small boat in a
mixed fleet, this is a great time to draft on the stern wave of a
larger boat.
Sailing up the line on a starboard beam reach gives you
right of way. Expect bad air and crowds to slow your progress,
so set up early. If you approach on a broader reach timing is
trickier. Be prepared to duck boats to leeward. At the other
end, approach on starboard and then jibe after you clear the
line.

run, timing is tricky. Set
the spinnaker early and
sail fast. Control your
approach by oversteering,
but keep speed. Pick a side
to get clear air.

breeze first and roll over you before you get it. From the lee-
ward position you have right of way. A good start is essen-
tial. If you fall into bad air, you risk being rolled by one boat
after another.
As a small boat in a mixed fleet, the leeward position
may not work out, as you’ll get rolled by faster boats. In hull
speed conditions there is an opportunity to hitch a ride on the
quarter wave or stern wave of a larger boat by dropping in
from close to windward (Fig. 2).
Wind Aft of the Beam
With the wind abaft the beam and the rhumb line per-
pendicular starting line, clear air is available only at the
weather end, and everyone knows it. Reaching up the line
will give you luffing rights on those reaching into the line
from above, but no wind.
Don’t be surprised if the entire fleet does not respond to
your hail to clear out as you charge up the line. In a crowd
boats are insulated by their neighbors, and often there is no
way to respond. Boats with right-of-way and no air are often
bowled over by the mass of boats reaching in.
A start which gets your nose out in front of the crowd
and into clear air can mean winning the race. Here again
there is an opportunity for small boats to draft in the stern
wave of larger boats (Fig. 3).

Fig. 2 - On a reach when the wind is forward of the beam, a start at
the leeward end of the line gives the best sailing angle. An on time,
full speed start is essential. There is a danger of getting rolled by one
boat after another if you fall into bad air. In a mixed fl eet, there are
particular problems for small boats.

Port Tack Fetch
When a big left hand shift makes the first leg a port tack
fetch (or near fetch), blast off the line on port tack. The fleet
tends to bunch up at the port end to the line, barely fetching or
not fetching the line on starboard tack. Avoid the jam up, and
start in the middle of the line.
Two approaches are recommended. One is a port tack
approach, ducking starboard tackers, and finding a gap in the
crowd. The other is a starboard approach. Sail up the line on
starboard, find an open space, and tack. Allow time to build
speed on port. Regardless of approach, the goal is to reach in
and blast off!
From a midline position you will be ahead and to leeward
of the pack. If the breeze backs further, you may fetch. If the
breeze clocks, you will lead the fleet into the header. Mean-
while, the pack at the port end will be jammed up, sailing the
wrong way, and unable to tack out (Fig. 4).
6.3 Starts on One-Legged Beats
When a big wind shift turns the first leg of a race into a
fetch or near fetch, starting tactics change. Typically the line is
square to the mark (and original wind) and heavily skewed to
the new wind.
Ideally, when there is a big shift before the start of a race,
the Race Committee will delay the start and reset the course,
but that is not always the case. When a shift turns the first leg
into a one-legged beat, the goal of starting strategy is to get off
the line, with speed, sailing on the tack to the mark. The exact
position on the line is not important. Lets take a look at the two
cases: Port tack fetch and starboard tack fetch.

Chapter 6: Offbeat Starts 	Page 51
Starboard Tack Fetch
When the breeze clocks to create a starboard tack fetch,
the same principles apply. Blast off the line on starboard tack.
Your position on the line is not important—getting away clean
is. Avoid the crowd at the starboard end; boats in the crowd
push each other up as they fight for clear air, and they end up
sailing extra distance. Take off from the middle of the line. You
will be ahead and to leeward of the crowd; you will be inside
(for a port rounding) if the leg becomes a fetch; and you will
lead the fleet into the header if the breeze backs. A timed out
and back approach is best (Fig. 5).
One-Legged Beats
The tactics for starts on one-legged beats boil down to
starting with speed on the tack toward the mark. Position on
the line is not important, but clear air is. This strategy applies
to any reaching start with the wind forward of the beam and the
line perpendicular to the leg.
6.4 Conclusion
Starts are critical, and offbeat starts are no exception. Off-
beat starts provide a great opportunity for those who can take
advantage of their unique characteristics. It is remarkable how
the start can shape the entire race, even a distance race. Try to
anticipate the actions of other boats, and get in position to start
with clear air and good speed.

Starting Quiz Answers
1. While setting up for a port tack approach, you notice
another boat appears to be doing the same thing. What should
you do?
Start up the line early to put some space between you. If
the rival follows immediately, the loop back behind
him, and get into the push position.
2. You are setting up for a boat end start using a triangle
approach and notice a surprise wind shift which makes the pin
end favored. What should you do?
Change your plan. You should know the timed length
of the line. Modify your approach to pretend you’ve
already completed leg one of the triangle. Time your
approach to be in the lower third of the line.
3. How can you tell which end is favored and how much
difference does it make?
Compare the compass course of the line to the wind direc-
tion. You can plot it on the race planner. A line 10° out
of square offers an advantage equal to 25% of the length
of the line.
4. The right end is 10° favored, but the left side is favored
upwind. Where should you start?
Try the middle, or even upper third of the line. The key is
a clear air lane which will allow you to get to the fa-
vored left side.
5. What is the purpose of sailing the course in miniature before
the start? Why do a practice start? What else should you do
during the hour before the race?
Whoa there - one at a time. We sail the course in minia-
ture to be able to anticipate the mix of starboard and
port upwind, and the wind angle downwind. This in turn
helps us plan strategy.
A practice starts helps with timing, crew organization, and
psyche. See Chapter 2 for a list of things to do prior to
the start.
6. How can you tell if you are over early when you can only see
one end of the line?
Use a line sight to an object off the extension of pin end.
If you can only see the boat end, look into the eyes of
the line caller. If your bow is sticking out, you’re likely
over early.
7. You are approaching the line close-hauled. A rival skipper to
leeward is yelling at you: “UP UP UP!”
How should you respond?
If the other boat is close, then respond and head up, but
you don’t need to say anything. Sail your boat. You
must stay clear and the other boat must give you room
to do so.
8. You are close-hauled approaching the stern of the committee
boat and you hail an inside boat which is barging. Moments
later the gun fi res and the return hail is, “Now we want room.”
What should you do?
Tell him, “No room, NO WAY!”
If the inside boat forces their way in, get the attention
of the RC while you give them room. Get the RC to
witness that you gave room to a barging boat. Avoid
collisions.
9. You are the third smallest boat in a PHRF start with twenty
boats. How will your size affect your strategy? What if you are
the largest boat?
As a smaller boat you will have to fight to hold a clear
lane to the favored side. It can be a struggle. At times it
seems you must choose between going the right way in
bad air, the wrong way in clear air, or tacking too much.
As a big boat, punch out, get clear air, and put your speed
to work. If you get stuck in the mix it can be hard to
break free.
10. What are the best ways to waste time if you are early on
your approach?
We are all uniquely qualified in our ability to waste time.

what to expect, our strategy will change. First, we would not
pursue the strategy as wholeheartedly. Second, we would
devote more than the usual amount of attention to watching
for changing conditions which might require us to change our
strategy.
Our strategy will depend on the predicted conditions and
our confidence in that prediction. When we are able to predict
conditions accurately and confidently, our strategic planning
is relatively easy. In practice our predictions often prove less

on wind, wind shifts, and current. Tactics, which we cover later,
involves implementing our strategy and dealing with other
boats.
C HAPTER 7: U PWIND S TRATEGY
7.1 Introduction to Strategy
Strategy vs Tactics
Strategy is our racing plan based on wind, wind shifts, and
current. Tactics, on the other hand, are techniques we use for
positioning and control of other boats or groups of boats. Strat-
egy involves the big picture; tactics focuses in close. Strategy
is long term and planned, tactics is more immediate and spon-
taneous.
Strategy is Wind, Wind Shifts, and Currents
There are three factors in planning strategy. We look for
better wind. We try to take advantage of wind shifts. And we
try to get favorable (or not unfavorable) current. The relative
importance of each factor depends on how variable each is
(Fig. 1).
7.2 Predicting Conditions
Our strategy is based on the expected conditions. The
more accurately we can predict the wind and current, the more
confidently we can form our strategic plan. As we discussed in
Chapter Two, our predictions are derived primarily from our
own observations during the hour before the start, and our ex-
perience sailing in a particular area. We revise our predictions
as we continue to observe conditions during the race.
The figure shows a sample Wind Graph based on our pre-
race observations. By carefully tracking the wind we can more
accurately predict the wind for the race (Fig. 2).
Predictable vs Unpredictable
One issue in our strategic planning is our confidence in
our forecast. When conditions are highly predictable, we can
pursue our strategy with conviction. When we are unsure of

than accurate, and our planning boils down to playing the odds
to reduce risks and increase possible gains.
Strategy and Conditions
As we said, our strategic planning revolves around the
expected conditions. When we know what to expect, we will be
able to make a firm plan. When our forecast is uncertain, then
our plan will be less well defined.
Strategy and conditions are related in another way. The
more variable the wind and current, the more important strat-
egy will be to our success. In stable conditions boat speed will
be the dominant concern. Our focus depends on what we see as
the key to success in today’s conditions.

7.3 Wind
Wind Strength
Find more wind. Sail in stronger wind more of the time
and you can’t lose. There are several things to look for to find
more wind.
Look for wind on the water. Stand up in your boat and
look upwind. Puffs create dark patches on the water. It is
tricky to distinguish shadows, changes in bottom color, and dif-
ferences due to sunlight; but the wind is there if you can pick it
out.
The wind changes near shore. Most of our racing is done
close enough to shore that winds vary across the course. Often
there is better wind near shore. When the wind is blowing on-
shore the thermals near shore create more wind. In an offshore
wind the thermal mixing near shore sometimes pushes the
stronger winds from aloft down to the surface. At other times
the wind is lighter near shore. By paying attention and keeping
records, you will be able to anticipate the change in wind as
you get near shore.
Clouds often bring more wind. In partly cloudy condi-
tions, there is often more wind at the edges of the clouds, and
less wind directly under the clouds. In a clearing northwest
wind with rows of cumulus clouds, there are usually down
drafts of stronger wind around the clouds. If you see frontal
clouds or building cumulus go to them—there is wind at the
edges, but less wind beneath them.
The Favored Side
A windward leg will often have a favored side. Boats sail-
ing to one side will have an advantage due to favorable wind,
wind shifts, or current. Sometimes it is difficult to anticipate
which side is favored. After observing the first leg we will have
a better idea for the second time around. If conditions don’t
change, then we would expect the same side to be favored
again. Also, after seeing particular conditions in a local area a
number of times, we will be able to anticipate which side will
be favored (Fig. 3).
Time Out for Terminology
Before we go on about the favored side a few details of
terminology must be cleared up: The favored side of the course
carries some strategic advantage. The favored tack takes you
to the favored side. This should not be confused with the long
tack, which is the predominant tack on a skewed beat, (i.e. a
beat where we spend more time on one tack than the other.
Often it is strategically correct to sail the long tack first – that
is, the long tack is often the favored tack. At other times the
favored tack might be the short tack (Fig. 4).
Left 	Middle 	Right
Fig. 3 – Often there is a
favored side. We sail to
the favored side of middle,
but avoid the corners.

Chapter 7: Upwind Strategy 	Page 57
commitment would make it difficult to recover. Second, as we
shall see, there are strategic and tactical reasons to avoid the
corners, since they can leave us out of position and with few
options. We would only sail to the extreme sides if:
• We are confident about our strategy and
• We must go to the extreme to get the advantage.
Caught on the Wrong Side: Now What?
What should you do if you sail to the favored side, get half
way up the beat, and realize it is not the favored side after all?
That is a tough question. Often it is surprising how close you
end up to the leaders if you bail out half way up the leg and cut
your losses. On the other hand, the ultimate frustration is bail-
ing out early and then seeing those who stuck with it come out
ahead in the end. Curses.
Of course, never having made such a mistake myself, it is
hard to offer insights. I can offer a few ideas based purely on
the experience of others:
• Don’t overcommit to begin with—play the middle. (Now
you tell me!)
• Hedge your bets. When in doubt stay with the pack.
• Be realistic about how things are going; don’t kid yourself.
• While you ponder what to do sail toward the middle, not
further into the corner.
Which Side is Favored?
How can you tell which side is favored before the race?
Here are some ways:
• Your own experience. Local knowledge can help you
guess the favored side based on past experience in simi-
lar weather.
• Testing. Sail to the sides of the course prior to the start.
Is there better breeze, or a consistent shift to one side?
Even if you can’t sail up the beat you can test wind
strength by reaching out off the extension of the line for
a couple of minutes.
• More testing. Test with a tuning partner. Each boat sails
to one side for a prescribed amount of time – say 3 min-
utes – and then tacks back. Who’s ahead?
• Observe earlier starts. In a multiple fleet event watch
those who go off before you do.
• Pay attention for the first few minutes of the race. If an
advantage is apparent, it is not too late to go after it.
Why is This Side Favored?
Hopefully we will know not only which side is favored, but
why. Knowing the reason will help us determine if conditions
have changed and the advantage has changed as well. If current
is the factor, for example, then a change in the tide can reverse
the advantage. If the advantage is due to the geography of the
surrounding shore, then the advantage will endure until the wind
changes. Knowing not just which, but why one side is favored
will help as we look ahead to plan our downwind strategy.
Right, Left, & Middle
In our discussion of strategy we will divide the windward
leg into three vertical segments; representing the left, right, and
middle of the course. When our strategy favors one side or the
other it is generally best to sail to the right or left of the middle,
but not beyond. There are several reasons to avoid the extreme
sides. For one, our strategy may prove to be wrong and a total
Fig. 4 – Don’t confuse the long
tack with the favored tack. On
a skewed beat, the favored tack
is not necessarily the long tack.

-- 64 of 191 --

Page 58 	RegattaFlow Playbook. Racing Tactics
7.4 Wind Shifts
The second strategic factor is wind shifts. Shifting winds
allow us to reach the windward mark more quickly than we can
in steady winds.
When the Wind Does Not Shift
When the wind is steady then the distance we must sail
to an upwind destination is fixed. We will sail X distance on
starboard tack, and Y distance on port tack to get to the mark.
If the mark is straight upwind, then X and Y will be equal. If
the leg is skewed, then they won’t be equal.
You can sail all port tack, and then tack to starboard, or all
the starboard tack first, or you can tack back and forth. In the
end, you will sail X distance on starboard tack and Y distance
on port tack to get to the mark. (Fig. 5.)
When the Wind Shifts
The wind shifts, and it is good. Wind shifts allow us to
shorten the distance we sail to an upwind mark.
When the wind shifts, our close-hauled compass courses
change. With each shift one tack is lifted up above its earlier
course, and the other tack in headed below its previous course.
When one tack is lifted the other is headed, and vice versa.
(Fig. 6).
Our goal upwind is to sail each tack when it is
lifted. By sailing the lifted tack, we sail a more direct
route to our upwind destination (Fig. 7).
Sail to the Shift
The fundamental upwind strategy is to sail toward the new
wind or wind shift. As we will see, this strategy keeps us on
the lifted tack. The application of this principle changes with
different types of shifts; but the fundamental rule—sail to the
shift—never changes.
Fig. 5 – Regardless of its path, in the absence of wind shifts, each
boat will sail the same distance on port tack and the same distance
on starboard tack. The distance on each tack is fi xed. The distance
on port tack will match the distance on starboard tack only if the
mark is directly upwind. If the mark is 1 mile directly upwind then
the distance on each tack would be .71 miles for boats tacking
through 90°.

tack will be lifted up toward the
mark while the other tack will be
headed away from the mark.
With the wind shifting to the right,
(at right) starboard tack is lifted,
and port tack is headed.
A shift to the left (below) lifts port.
Tracking Conditions
In order to take advantage of wind shifts you must keep
track of them. The best way to keep track of wind shifts is to
track your close-hauled compass course. Keep a record of com-
pass headings and establish a range of highs and lows for each
tack. By recording the shifts, you can look for patterns (see Fig.
2, earlier) and anticipate upcoming shifts.
Of course, reading the compass only tells about a shift
after it has arrived. In addition to the compass, observe the
wind on the water and watch its effect on other boats. Work to
recognize and predict shifts before they arrive.

Fig. 8b – In oscillating shifts the
wind swings back and forth
Fig. 8a – In a persistent shift the wind
shifts continuously in one direction. Oscillating Shifts
The basic strategy in an oscillating breeze is to tack with
the shifts. As the wind shifts, one tack is lifted so we can point
closer to the mark (or average wind) while the other tack is
headed further away. When the wind shifts again the advan-
tage will be reversed; whenever one tack is lifted the other is
headed. Each time we come about we are sailing toward the
next expected shift – sail to the shift. When the wind is from
the right, we sail lifted on starboard tack, toward the next shift,
which is expected from the left. When the left shift arrives
starboard tack will be headed, and port lifted. We tack again
and sail lifted on port, toward the next shift, from the right, and
so on. (Fig. 10)
By coming about when headed below the average course
and sailing on the lifted tack, we can take advantage of the
wind shifts to improve upwind performance. We use the term
staying in phase to describe the process of tacking on the head-
ers and sailing on the lifts.
Sometimes the wind shifts gradually back and forth. This
is seen most often when the winds are coming over open water.
We tack as we are headed below the average heading. At other
times the shifts hit all at once. We see this when the shifts are
coming off shore, or in the northwest winds after a cold front.
Types of Shifts
Wind shifts are generally categorized in two types: per-
sistent and oscillating. Persistent shifts swing gradually in
one direction, like the hands of a clock. A shift to the right is a
clocking shift, or “veer;” a shift to the left is called a “back.”
Oscillating winds shift back and forth, like a pendulum.
(Fig. 8 a, b)
From experience we know the real world is more complex
than simple oscillating or persistent shifts. For starters we are
going to look at strategy in these two textbook types of shifts.
After that we will look at other variations.
Persistent Shifts
The basic strategy in a persistent shift is to sail to the new
wind. As the wind gradually shifts, one tack will gradually
deteriorate, while the other improves. If the wind is shifting to
the right, then port tack will be at its best early and deteriorate
over time, while starboard tack will get better and better. We
would sail port tack first, before it is too badly headed, and sail
starboard tack later, when it is most lifted. (Fig. 9)

Chapter 7: Upwind Strategy 	Page 61
On starboard tack a higher compass reading is a lift, a
lower number is a header. On port lower is a lift, higher is a
header. It is most important to recognize headers since they
suggest it is time to tack. Use the phrase Port, Higher, Header
as an aid to remember the correlation between compass read-
ings and shifts.
Get in Phase
By collecting wind information before the race and updat-
ing information as the race progresses, we should know at any
moment whether we are sailing a lifted, headed, or average
course. If conditions change, our lifted and headed numbers
will have to be adjusted.
Out of Phase
Sailing in oscillations seems pretty straightforward. If the
shifts come in a regular cycle and no one gets in your way, it
should be easy to stay in phase. Somehow it doesn’t always
work that way. If you find yourself out of phase, sail the tack
which takes you closest to the mark, or towards the next puff,
while you sort things out.
Unbalanced Legs
Tacking as the wind crosses the average works great if the
wind spends equal time on each side of average and the mark
is straight upwind. This is not always the case. When the leg
or shifts are not balanced, then the crossover angle for tacking
must be adjusted to match. For example, if the leg is skewed to
three times as much starboard as port, then we’ll need to sail on
starboard for three quarters of the wind range, and port for one
quarter.
Similarly, if there are other strategic considerations, our
tacking angles may be skewed. For example, if there is better
wind or current to one side of the course, we would sail toward
the favored side during average winds, and sail away from that
side only at the extreme end of the shift spectrum.
Fig. 9 – In a persistent shift
we sail toward the shift. Fig. 10 – In oscillating
winds we do the same thing
over and over, always sailing
toward the next shift.

Page 62 	RegattaFlow Playbook. Racing Tactics
Sail to the Shift
Coming off the starting line on starboard tack our com-
pass reads 10°. A few minute later it reads 5°, and soon after
that, 0°. With each little header some of our competition tacks
away. Some tacked to port on the first header off the line. Oth-
ers have gradually bailed out as the header continues.
Eventually, with the compass reading 0°, we tack over.
Our course on port tack is 90°. We are short of the layline to
the mark. Gradually we are lifted, first to 85°, then 80°, 75°,
and finally 70°. We are lifted to the mark, far ahead of those
who tacked out early.
When Should We Tack?
The choice of where to tack is a little tricky. Theoretically
we want to tack so we will be lifted exactly to the mark. This
curved lifted layline would give us the full advantage of the
shift without sailing any extra distance. This is a tough call, to
say the least. A more realistic approach is to tack short of the
layline. Then, as you approach the mark, tack out again, and
take another guess. Don’t overstand or you’ll be sailing extra
distance. As you get closer to the mark, you should be able to
make a more accurate layline call.
Another (tactical) perspective on where to tack is to main-
tain position between the fleet and the shift. Don’t sail to the
corner – just get a controlling position.
So Much for the Competition
Coming off the starting line on starboard, we gradually
got headed. Some of the fleet played the header as an oscil-
lating shift, and tacked out. They expected to be headed again
(on port tack) before tacking back to starboard. This was a big
mistake. We knew from our Wind Graph that we were in a
persistent shift. We used persistent shift strategy by sailing into
the header, towards the new wind.
The boats which tacked out early kept getting lifted fur-
ther and further on port tack, which made starboard tack look
Persistent Shifts
The strategy in a persistent shift is to sail toward the new
wind. If the wind is shifting to the right, then go right. If the
wind is shifting left, go left.
Sail Headed
In a persistent shift, one tack is continuously getting
headed while the other is getting lifted. Our strategy is to first
sail the tack which is getting headed, then sail the tack which is
getting lifted. Why? The tack which is getting headed is getting
worse all the time. It is headed now, but will be headed more
later. Sail it now before it gets worse. The tack which is get-
ting lifted is improving all the time. If we sail it now we will be
missing a better lift later.
Are you Sure it’s a Persistent Shift?
How hard is it to split with the fleet and sail into a header?
Without our pre-race info, weather forecast, and/or observation
of other boats on which to build our strategy, it would be crazy.
Even with good information and a well thought out plan, it is
hard to stick to your guns as the fleet tacks away. If you know
what is coming, then go to it. Position yourself to the favored
side of the fleet.
The Rewards
How much do you gain by sailing into a persistent shift? It
depends how far the wind shifts and how far you are separated
from your competition; but in a word – plenty.
PERSISTENT E XAMPLE
We know from our Wind Graph that the wind is gradually
backing. Our starboard tack readings for the hour before the
start show a trend: 30° > 25° > 20° > 15°. The port tack com-
pass readings are similar: 120° > 115° > 110° > 105°. Starboard
is getting progressively headed, while port is getting lifted. The
forecast tells of a low passing to the south. We expect the wind
to continue to back (Fig. 11).

Fig. 11 – Wind Graph and strategy for a Persistent Shift.
This Wind Graph shows a persistent shift to the left. As the
wind worked its way left it nearly ran off our graph. At 11:55
we had to reset the wind graph to re-center our numbers.
By gathering wind information before the start we were able to
form a sound race strategy to take advantage of the expected
new wind. As always, we sailed toward the next shift.
Challenge Question: Why does the wind often seem to shift
faster or more often after the start? The answer is embedded
in Chapter 10.

worse and worse. The port tack boats ended up sailing what is
known as the great circle route, getting lifted around the out-
side of the mark.
Too Far Ahead?
If the fleet goes right and you think the wind is going left,
then position yourself to the left of the fleet. Don’t split com-
pletely with the fleet, for two reasons:
First, if you split and you are right, you will end up way
ahead, and everyone will think you were just lucky. You don’t
want to win by too much; just a comfortable margin that will let
everyone see who is out front.
Second, if you split with the fleet and happen to be wrong,
you are sunk. (Somehow it is not unlucky to be half a mile
behind – you are just bad.) Hedge your bets.

OSCILLATING EXAMPLE
Pre-Race Data
In preparation for our 12:15 start we periodically record
and plot our wind information. Using the close-hauled compass
course on each tack, we are able to calculate the wind direction.
The Wind Graph from our Race Planner shows the following
(Fig. 12):
• An oscillating breeze, shifting back and forth.
• Starboard tack headings ranged from 170° to 185°.
• Port tack headings ranged from 260° to 275°.
• We tack through 90°; from 170° on starboard to 260° on
port, or from 185° to 275°.
• The wind speed is a steady 8 to 9 knots.
Stay in Phase—Tack on the Headers
Coming off the starting line, we are sailing on starboard
with a compass course of 180° to 185°. These are high num-
bers for starboard tack, which means we are lifted. Gradually
our course drops to between 175° and 180°. This is an average
course, neither headed or lifted, and we can sail on either tack.
Soon the crew reports that our course has dropped below
175°. Other boats are showing similar angles. We are headed.
We tack. As we settle on port tack the compass reads 260°–
265°, low numbers which mean we are lifted on port tack. As
the numbers rise, we are getting headed. Remember: Port,
Higher, Header. When our course falls below our average, we
tack again and sail lifted on starboard.
As the plot shows, we continue tacking on the headers in
the oscillating shifts. Gradually we find ourselves to the left of
the middle of the course. We use the time when the wind is at
the average direction to sail on port tack, which returns us to
the middle. We sail on starboard only when lifted above 180°;
we sail on port for any heading between 260° and 270°.
A New High!
Further up the leg, we are sailing lifted on starboard.
Compass readings show a course between 180° and 185°.
Gradually we are lifted to 190°. At this point lights should
flash, bells should ring, and sirens should sound. 190° is be-
yond our range of oscillations. We are lifted higher than ever
before.
We may have to reevaluate the conditions and modify our
strategy. What is causing this new reading? Helmsman error?
Changing weather? Are we closer to shore? Are there any new
clouds? What is going on with the rest of the fleet?
Is this a momentary aberration, after which we will return
to earlier conditions? Or is this the beginning of a persistent
shift? Perhaps the wind will continue to oscillate, but over a
new range or wider range.
The key is to first recognize that something new is hap-
pening. The next step is to evaluate the change and make plans
accordingly. Ideally we would have seen it coming—either
from wind on the water, an expected shift near shore, or by
observing other boats (in an earlier class—we are leading our
fleet, remember).
The Impact of Shifts – Don’t Miss ’Em
Meanwhile, one of our competitors has sailed off the line
on starboard tack and continued one third of the way up the leg
before tacking. From there he sailed across the course on port
tack, to the starboard tack layline. Ignoring the shifts has left
our rival out of phase and sailing headed half the time. On the
other hand, he has only had to tack twice! On a two mile beat
with 10° oscillations, a boat which sails in phase will be min-
utes ahead of a boat which ignores the shifts. That’s even after
we throw in the cost of a couple of extra tacks!
A little later, we’ll pull out our slide rules and find out just
how big a deal wind shifts are, but for now, just remember:
Track the shifts, and hit ’em!

Other Types of Shifts
As we said above, pure persistent and pure oscillating
wind shifts are quite rare. There are infinite variations.
One variation is a mix of persistent and oscillating shifts.
This mixed condition is characterized by oscillating shifts
gradually shifting one way or the other – veering or backing
– over time.
Several other types of wind shifts occur. One is a major
shift where a new wind completely replaces the existing wind.
This can happen suddenly, or after a period of calm. Winds
vary in other ways. There are geographic shifts caused by the
configuration of land, and thermal wind shifts created by the
heating of land. There are also differences in the wind due to
differences in current (as we will see below), and there are
shifts caused by the movement of weather systems.
Mixed Conditions
In mixed conditions, combining both oscillations and per-
sistent characteristics, the strategy is to sail toward the persis-
tent shift while still playing the embedded oscillations.
Part of the trick in coping with these mixed conditions is
to realize that the range of oscillations is gradually changing.
The high and low numbers on each tack will be increasing or
decreasing. What was once a header may now be the median,
with a new lower header on the way.
When conditions are too confusing to diagnose, the fall
back strategy is to sail to the mark. Which ever tack takes you
closer to the mark is preferred until there is reason to do other-
wise.
MIXED C ONDITIONS EXAMPLE
Here is an example of strategy in mixed conditions
(Fig. 13).
Pre-Race Data
Our pre-race data is listed in the Wind Graph. It shows
mixed conditions. The trend is veering, but we have oscilla-
tions as well. Our strategy will have to consider both; we will
also have to keep a keen eye out for changes in conditions.
One thing to look for is stronger breeze to one side. Is the trend
shifting and building (as in this example) or shifting and fad-
ing.
. . . And They’re Off
It is interesting to see the different strategies which
emerge from these difficult conditions. Some of the fleet will
treat the beat as though they were sailing a persistent shift.
Others will tack on the headers. Some will try to balance the
mix. And still others will be confused and uncertain of how to
handle the conditions.
As the fleet moves up the beat in mixed conditions, the
apparent leaders will change with each shift. Often it is unclear
until the last shift of the leg who will come out ahead.
Keep Fighting
In mixed conditions you are never out of it. Keep work-
ing, keep trying to decipher the next shift. There are plenty of
opportunities to catch up (and more than enough chances to get
confused). If you find yourself baffled, try to regroup. Every-
one will have their moments—if you can keep from going to
pieces during your bad moments, you’ll have another chance
for good times.

winds are generally shifted to the right of the surface winds (at
least in the northern hemisphere).
The effect of these geographic changes can be either per-
sistent or oscillating. In offshore winds, there will commonly
be a mixed effect—with puffs coming from shore lifting the
tack which is parallel to shore, and with those lifts being stron-
ger the closer you get to shore.
The thermal effects on an onshore wind usually create a
persistent shift from the prevailing wind direction to the normal
sea breeze direction (Fig 16).
For more on weather, see the RegattaFlow Playbook. Weather for Sailors
book and CD-ROM.
Geographic Shifts
We do most of our racing near shore, where the interaction
of the land and water affects our sailing wind. Further offshore
conditions are more stable and predictable; but along the coast
wind conditions are difficult to predict.
There are many ways the shoreline changes the wind.
First, the shoreline funnels the wind. The wind shifts to follow
the shoreline. Second, offshore winds tend to shift more per-
pendicular to the shoreline (Fig. 14). Third, winds shift around
obstacles such as hills, buildings, and thermal domes in areas
with lots of pavement (Fig. 15).
Fourth, the heating of the land creates thermal winds—sea
breezes—which blow towards shore during the day.
Fifth, the thermals create turbulence and mixing which
can pull the upper winds down to the surface. These upper
Fig. 14 – Offshore winds tend to shift
more perpendicular to the shoreline. 	Fig. 15 – A city or hill can create oscillating
shifts, with bigger shifts near shore. 	Fig. 16 – As the land heats up, you
get a persistent shift as the prevailing
wind shifts to the sea breeze direction.

Weather System Wind Shifts
A Major Change
As weather systems move or weaken, one wind can
replace another. A prevailing wind may be pushed aside by a
thermal, or a new weather system wind may arrive. Whatever
the cause, there are occasions where a new and different wind
appears and all the earlier information becomes irrelevant.
If we can anticipate this change based on forecasts or ob-
servations (new clouds etc.) and be in position for it, there can
be tremendous gains. But beware–There is a danger in chas-
ing the predicted conditions and expecting a shift which does
not arrive as scheduled. Summer weather systems often stall or
even disappear as the get to the coast.
Squall Winds
Another type of weather system wind is a localized late
afternoon squall. These can turn the entire fleet on its head.
Squalls create two opportunities—one as the squall hits, and
the other as the squall passes.
Be prepared. If you are ready to shorten sail and race
through the squall while others scramble, huge gains are pos-
sible. Sail toward the new shift – usually the wind backs to the
left – to avoid windward work once it arrives. A squall drill
should be part of your crew training.
If the squall is localized, then after the squall passes
conditions often return to the conditions which existed prior
to the squall. If the squall is part of an advancing cold front,
then conditions behind the front will be entirely different from
earlier. By recognizing the type of squall you may be able to
anticipate conditions during and after its passage.
Wind Shear
Wind shear is a condition where there are layers of
wind—one at the surface, and the other aloft. Wind shear is
uncommon. It occurs most often over smooth cold water early
on a spring day, or at night.
There is a boundary layer of cool air on the surface, and a
different wind aloft. Sail trimming with the wind 30° or more
different from the deck to masthead can be baffling, to say the
least. Tactically it is a little more straightforward.
Generally the upper wind will become dominant. Funda-
mental wind strategy says sail toward the new wind—in this
case sail toward the upper wind, as it will eventually displace
the surface wind. If the upper wind is from the right, go right.
Here’s a trick if you are a small boat in a mixed fleet: Look at
the mastheads of larger boats. Sometimes you will be able to
find a wind shear (and a clue to the expected wind) which does
not show at your masthead (Fig. 17).
Don’t confuse wind shear with wind gradient. Wind gra-
dient is the tendency for winds at the mast head to be stronger
than those at deck level. It exists almost all the time, and is
more dramatic in light air, less pronounced in heavy air.

7.5 The Impact of Wind Shifts
It is often difficult to predict the wind. Is it worth it to try
to figure out what the wind is going to do next? How much dif-
ference does it make?
The Impact of Persistent Shifts
We’ll assume here a course set to the wind at the start,
with incremental shifts to the right. For the initial segments
boats make equal progress upwind. Then the wind shifts 5° to
the right.
The boat on port tack, going right, is headed. The tacti-
cian struggles with his own convictions, and resists the tide
of sentiment to tack on the header. Meanwhile the boats on
starboard are lifted up toward the mark – Yippee!
They sail on.
Another shift, further right. Finally, the tactician going
right calls for a tack. Now they are lifted on starboard – higher
than any lift they’d seen before the start.
The boats going left are in a quandary. They are lifted,
but the wind is going right. The black boat bites the bullet, and
tacks. It is very hard to tack when you are lifted – if you don’t
believe me, you’ve never tried it. But it is the right thing to do.
If the wind continues right, then there is nothing to be gained
by continuing to the left. Cut your loses, and sail to the shift.
The grey boat carries on, hoping for an oscillation. Its a
gamble – if the persistent shift continues, his position will go
from bad to worse. He’s sailing the great circle route and will
never get a good angle to sail to the mark. But, BUT, if the
wind oscillates back, (oh please, oh please) even for just a short
time, he can recover nicely. (Fig. 18)
Fig 18 – Persistent shifts – sail to the new wind!
Here are some numbers, assuming a 5° shift every 5 minutes, with the
boats sailing at 6 knots: After 20 minutes the checkered boat will be
1.5 miles upwind of the starting line, and over 1/4 mile ahead of the
black boat. The checkered boat will be on just 1/8 mile ahead of the
grey boat, but that lead will be growing quickly.
The black boat would be expected to cross the grey boat when he tacks.

-- 77 of 191 --

Chapter 7: Upwind Strategy 	Page 71
The Impact of Oscillations
We’ll start first with a boat sailing upwind, with a tack-
ing angle of 90°. Using trigonometry (yikes), we find that the
distance sailed is 1.42 times the straight-line distance. To sail to
a mark one mile upwind, the boat will have to sail a total of .71
miles on port tack, and .71 miles on starboard tack.
If the wind is oscillating as little as 5° either side of the
median, then performance improves significantly. To sail to a
mark one mile upwind, the boat will have to sail a total of .65
miles on port tack, and .65 miles on starboard tack. By taking
advantage of the shifts, the distance sailed is reduced to 1.30
times the straight-line distance. That’s a savings of over a tenth
of a mile – over 600 feet!
If the wind is oscillating 10° either side of the median,
then performance improves dramatically. To sail to a mark one
mile upwind, the boat will have to sail a total of .61 miles on
port tack, and .61 miles on starboard tack. By taking advantage
of the shifts, the distance sailed is reduced from 1.42 to 1.22
times the straight line distance. A savings of .20 miles, which
is nearly 15%, or about 1200 feet! (Fig. 19)
At a boat speed of 6 knots this represents 120 seconds – or
two minutes in one mile! These numbers are for big right or
left shifts – not a gradual oscillation, and for a boat sailing the
wind shifts perfectly. But even at 25% effi ciency, you’ll still
save 30 seconds per mile!
Hit the shifts!

7.6 Current
Current adds complexity to strategic planning. The obvi-
ous, and primary, strategic concern is to seek out better (more
favorable or less adverse) current. When the current is not uni-
form across the course, it can be an overriding strategic factor.
Currents run stronger in deep water than in shallow, and faster
in narrows than in open water. Below points and around bends,
eddies can develop. They can race across flats. 	Adding further
complexity is the fact that currents change. Correct strategy can
change dramatically over a period of hours. Storms and strong
winds can distort surface currents and delay tides, sometimes
making tide tables useless (Fig. 20).
Wind Driven Current
Currents are not limited to rivers and tidal basins. In the
Great Lakes, for example, currents of one full knot are possi-
ble. Currents build when strong winds drive the surface water.
After the winds abate, the currents reverse as the water, which
has been stacked up at one end of the lake, returns to level
(Fig. 21).
Uniform Across the Course
When the current is uniform throughout the course, it af-
fects the laylines and sailing angles to the mark. If it is running
across the course, then it can also change the balance of time
spent on each tack (Fig. 22).
Fig. 21– Wind can create current. Wind driven current can
exaggerate or reverse tidal currents in shallow bays. And it
can create currents where there otherwise would be none.
After the wind has pushed water to one end of a basin, the
current will reverse when the wind subsides.
Fig. 20– Currents are created by tides and rivers. They run
stronger in channels than in shallows, and can be a major
strategic factor.

-- 79 of 191 --

Chapter 7: Upwind Strategy 	Page 73
Fig. 22 – When the current is uniform throughout the leg, the
biggest impact is on laylines into the mark. Current can also
skew the course, changing the balance of time on each tack.
When Current is Not Uniform
When the current is not the same across the course area,
then we must seek out the advantage. Differences across the
course can shape our strategy. Unless there are dramatic differ-
ences in wind conditions a current advantage is key to strategic
planning.
Current to one side
Obviously if the current is stronger to one side seek out
that side if it is favorable, and avoid that side if it is adverse. A
favorable current, running against the wind, can set up a pro-
nounced chop. Look for this. Sail into the choppy water and
ride the current upwind. Similarly, smooth water can indicate
wind and current running together. Avoid this area upwind
(Fig. 23).
Fig. 23 – When there is
stronger current to one side,
go to it if favorable, sail away
if adverse. The advantage can
change with the tides.
Current across the course
When the current runs across the course and is stronger in
one part of the leg, you want to take advantage of the change
in sailing wind caused by the current. Sailing bow into the
current, you will be lifted; sailing with the current astern, you
will be headed. For example, in ten knots of wind and one knot
of current the sailing wind is shifted 6°. With one tack lifted
and the other headed, the effect is a 20% advantage in VMG
(Fig. 24).
Predictable, to a Point
Current, whether tidal or river generated, is predictable.
Tide tables and current charts should be studied, and their
predictions compared with observation. When the current runs
strong it is often more reliable and predictable than the wind; a
small current advantage translates into big gains.

-- 80 of 191 --

Page 74 	RegattaFlow Playbook. Racing Tactics
In tidal areas the advantage can be fleeting—or reverse—
over the course of a race. Obviously we need to pay attention
to changes in the tide.
Changes with Wind Conditions
The wind can upset current predictions, particularly in
shallow water. A strong wind blowing over a long period can
overwhelm tidal effects, pushing surface water and delaying or
reversing tides. When the winds abate, the current distortions
will remain until the water has had a chance to return to level
by flowing in the direction opposite the earlier wind. Winds
can also create currents where there otherwise are none, as
mentioned above.
Effects on Sailing Wind
Current changes the sailing wind for a boat. The sailing
wind is the sum of the true wind over the bottom and the cur-
rent. When sailing upwind, the net effect of current on the wind
reinforces the effect or the current. A favorable current creates
a favorable change in the sailing wind, and an adverse current
makes for an unfavorable change in the sailing wind (Fig. 25).
Details are explained in Chapter 13: Weather.
Develop Local Knowledge
One key to success in current is to develop local knowl-
edge. Keep records of how the current runs in various wind
and tide combinations. Our strategic plan is only as good as
the information it is based on. Accurate current information is
critical to good strategic planning.
Fig. 24 – When current is not uniform, take advantage of the
shift in sailing wind. In this example we have 10 knots of wind,
1 knot of current, and boats tacking through 90°. The current
gives one boat a 6° lift, the other a 6° header. The lifted boat’s
VMG is 20% better than the headed boat’s. (VMG is normally
.71 of boat speed. The shift is 6° because arc-tan 6°=1/10.
A 6° lift creates a VMG of .78, a 6° header creates a VMG of
.63. .63/.78=.80. I’m glad you asked.)

create our sailing wind.

7.8 The Land of Opportunity
It happens, even to the best of racers. You find yourself at
the tail end of the fleet. Who knows how you got there—a third
row start, a miserable first beat, a big shift, a boat handling
disaster. I will not dwell on the ways to fall behind; at that, it
seems, we are all uniquely qualified.
The Most Important Race
So, you’re back in the pack. What should you do?
Before getting into details, recognize that in any regatta
or series your worst race is often the most important. One
astronomical score can shatter an otherwise competitive record.
The ability to bring that astronomical finish down to earth is
the mark of a champion, and success starts with attitude.
Don’t Dwell
As a skipper you should take charge. Never mind how we
got into this mess—let’s focus on getting out of it. (Besides,
more than likely it was your fault.) (Fig. 27).
Fig. 27– Sooner or later, you will fi nd yourself in “The Land of
Opportunity.”
7.7 Strategy vs. Rivals
While dealing with other boats is really a tactical issue,
other boats can enter into our strategic planning. Late in a se-
ries we may be concerned with particular boats which are close
to us in the standings.
It is good strategy to consider your close rivals, but do not
let them distract you from sailing your own boat well. There is
a danger in becoming preoccupied with the opponent. The ri-
vals are but one strategic factor. If you sail your own boat well,
the rest will fall into place. If you sail badly, then you stand a
greater chance of losing your private war.
The basic strategy when ahead is to stay between the com-
petition and the next mark (Fig. 26).
When behind the basic strategy is to split with the rival,
but not simply for the sake of splitting. If you are behind and
the rival is going the right way, splitting will leave you further
behind. You have to be patient and look for your opportunities.
For further discussion see Chapter 8: Upwind Tactics, next.
There are times when you may be close enough behind in the
race to be able to preserve a lead in the series. In this case the
strategy is simply to follow the rival. You must, of course, con-
sider handicap time differences when evaluating your position.
Fig. 26 – Cover your chief rivals.
Stay between them and the next
mark or the new wind.

How Many Can We Pass?
When you find yourself at the wrong end of the fleet, don’t
get depressed. You are in The Land of Opportunity—there is
a whole fleet of boats waiting to be passed! Don’t wait for a
miracle to save you. Get to work and grind ’em down, one at
a time. You’re not going to win this race; that is no longer the
goal. Actually, winning is redefined for this race: Winning is
passing as many boats as you can.
Sail Fast & Go the Right Way
Don’t panic. Settle down and work on boat speed. You
will not pass anyone without good speed. Concentrate on
speed, and you should be able to knock off a few tail-enders
easily.
Go the right way. In The Land of Opportunity you must
concentrate more on your overall strategy than on immediate
tactics with those nearby. Upwind, figure out which side of the
course is favored and head that way. Back here it is hard to sail
the middle; all that gets you is traffic and bad air. You must
pick a side. Do it carefully – you can’t afford another mistake.
If you are not sure which way to go (maybe that’s how you
landed in the Land of Opportunity), look to the leaders for
guidance. The leaders are probably doing what is right – hint:
they’re in the lead. Others will gamble against the odds in
hopes of passing the leaders. Our goal is pass the gamblers.
Sail Clean, Fast, Smart
On the reaches, you can save distance by sailing the
rhumb line while letting others waste distance sailing high and
then low. Avoid luffing duels, plan well ahead for the inside
position at roundings and, above all, keep sailing fast.
Running legs offer an opportunity to attack those ahead.
For all you need to know about Running Strategy and Tactics,
skip ahead a few chapters. There are real opportunities here.
The Promised Land
Hopefully you’ve fallen behind early, so you have plenty
of time to catch up. Play the shifts and work the favored side;
and keep sailing fast. Position yourself carefully to pick up a
few boats at each mark rounding. Look ahead for changing
conditions and be ready to respond.
Sometimes, late in a race you may need to gamble, split
with the fleet, and hope to get lucky. But don’t panic if you fall
behind early. Don’t count on luck. Get to work.
Every boat you pass is worth a point, and it is easier to
move from 15th to 5th than it is from 5th to first. When you
find yourself in The Land of Opportunity, keep cool, sail fast,
go the right way, and avoid confrontations. You can reach The
Promised Land. The End (Fig. 28).
Fig. 28 – When you fall behind (as on the previous page) get to
work. With grit, determination, and a little luck, you can reach
The Promised Land.

7.9 Local Knowledge
Consistent success in a local area depends on local knowl-
edge. You must learn to recognize local conditions and know
the strategy which is called for.
When I raced collegiality at Yale, our team captain, Steve
Benjamin, required us to complete a regatta report for every re-
gatta we sailed. All the regatta reports were compiled into a note-
book. Later, when I went racing on the Charles River in Boston,
for example, I could refer to dozens of reports by my teammates
covering the boats and sailing conditions I would face.
Local Knowledge: Racing in Annapolis
Each year it seems I race a regatta or two on Chesapeake
Bay, out of Annapolis. The northern bay offers a challenging
sailing venue. It is close enough to the ocean to be affected by
sea breezes, and far enough north to be battered by cold fronts
in early fall, when I seem to do most of my racing there. Winds
come from all points and in all strengths. The currents run
strong and vary widely across the bay. The winds have a big ef-
fect on the current, sometimes making a joke of the tide tables.
(Refer to the chart on the next page.)
Disclaimer
Following are my impressions. God save you if you are
foolish enough to follow my strategic advice when you go rac-
ing on Chesapeake Bay.
South East/South Sea Breeze
Comes in on top of prevailing southerly or when no other
weather pattern is firmly in place. South East to South winds are
generally shifty but not strong. Current is important, since this
wind takes us diagonally across the bay. Beware of getting too
far in toward the Eastern Shore. The breeze tends to run lighter
and more southerly there, lifting starboard and making it painful
to tack out onto port—and easy to take the great circle route.
Against the current you must get very close to the eastern
shore to avoid the current in the main channel, and this often
leads to great circle route just described. It seems better to stay
right to avoid some current and still keep breeze. Tendency to
clock also favors the right.
With an outbound current, sail to the main channel to get
to the current but stay right once in the current. Avoid the left
corner.
South/South West Sea Breeze
The sea breeze will fill and reinforce a South to South
West wind. As the breeze builds, it does not back to the south
as might be expected (since ocean lies to S.E.). Winds around
200°—210° roll straight up the bay. Winds tend to clock, and
lift inshore between Tolly Point and Thomas Point.
Against the flood, the best tactic is to tack inside the line
between Tolly and Thomas (don’t forget to honor Tolly Pt.
Buoy) to avoid the current. With the wind tending right, all
signs lead inshore.
On the ebb, a more moderate strategy is called for; but
the channel is often out of reach to the left, and there is rarely
a strong ebb current against a southerly wind. The wind effec-
tively blocks the current, and wind strategy prevails.
Westerlies
The prevailing westerlies can become blustery after a
frontal passage. Most cold fronts take the wind N.W. or N., but
a post-frontal westerly is not uncommon. The races are gener-
ally started near the Eastern Shore, with the windward mark set
at the mouth of the Severn River. The wind tends to fan out of
the Severn, particularly in the upper half of the beat. Boats sail-
ing out to either side are lifted. They never get a favorable shift
for a return tack, and boats come back from the corners headed.
The wind also gets lighter off to the sides. Work the middle
for the steadiest and strongest winds coming straight out of the
Severn.

Chapter 7: Upwind Strategy 	Page 79
For triangle races, the reach mark is set in the middle
of the bay, south and east of Tolly Point. After rounding the
windward mark, particularly on the blustery days, the leg ap-
pears too tight for a spinnaker. Go ahead and set. Sail low on
the early part of the leg, in the strong winds from the Severn.
Later in the leg the breeze will lighten and fair, and it will be
advantageous to be able to reach up from below.
WARNING: Things don’t always work out this way on
the first reach. Sometimes a S. W. puff will come off the shore
inside Tolly Point and the boats inside will beam reach across,
while those down low struggle to reach up. It depends on the
wind direction (S. or N. of W.?) and the position of the mark
(the closer under Tolly Point the more likely S.W. puffs are to
be a factor).
The second reach across the bay is dominated by current.
The same is true of the later part of any leeward leg. The cur-
rent runs strongest near the mark. Overcorrect for the current
early to make sure you are sailing with it late in the leg. (Work
south on a flood, north on an ebb). The wind tends to be much
lighter on the Eastern Shore and you don’t want to have to fight
the current in the main channel.
In the westerlies, the wind tends to be stronger by the river
than on the eastern shore. Be ready for more breeze at the top
of the leg.
If the frontal passage is weak the sea breeze may push the
breeze to the S.W. in the afternoon. A strong front will tend to
clock the breeze to the N.W.
Northwest Wind
After a frontal passage in the fall the strong N.W. winds
provide some of the year’s best sailing. From a start in mid-
bay the windward mark is set at the mouth of Whitehall Bay or
off Hackett Pt. to the east. Coming off the line there tend to be
starboard tack lifts, with the boats up the line gaining an advan-
tage. From there the race is often a sprint to the left in search of
puffs from the Severn. The puffs are starboard headers, allow-
ing a tack to port and a lifted track into the mark.
North Wind
In a northerly there is no fixed strategy. With the mark set
below the bridge there may be some port lifts off Whitehall,
but there may also be better breeze in the open part of the bay.
If the wind is clocking then plan a strategy to take advantage of
the persistent shift. Current can become a big factor. Stay left
to avoid an ebb. Go right to take advantage of a flood, though
the wind may diminish its strength.
Northeast Wind
As the frontal wind fades the breeze will clock to the
northeast. The temptation is to go right, and that strategy may
pay off early in the leg. But if the mark is set under the Eastern
Shore the right will be a problem later on. In the second half
of the beat boats coming in on port from the left hand side will
be favored by more northerly puffs which roll down from the
bridge, while those on the right suffer in fickle easterly puffs
off the shore and big northerly headers.
The current can be a big factor, as you will have to cross
the main channel on the way to the mark. After a strong north-
erly there will be little water left for an ebb, but beware the
flood which may run longer and much stronger than usual as
the bay refills.
Easterly Wind
The easterlies are among the most fickle and difficult of
bay breezes. One thing is for sure. Rain is on the way. Stay
home, stay dry; put in the storm windows until the rain starts,
then watch football on TV. Have you noticed that the Redskins
have been lousy since they closed Marmaduke’s?

Local Knowledge: Racing In Chicago
Lake Michigan offers residents of Chicago some of the
finest (though somewhat seasonal) sailing in the country. Con-
ditions vary through the full spectrum—from shifty westerlies
in smooth water to tremendous northerlies with jaw-breaking
waves. The 300 mile long lake is capable of dishing up any-
thing at anytime. And it is all fresh water!
Southwest Winds
Sail in toward the city for better breeze and a starboard lift.
West Winds
Look for dark patches coming off the city bringing breeze
and big shifts. If you fall behind don’t split – sail to the next
shift.
Northwest Wind
With a passing cold front, the N.W. wind will blow cool
and strong. Though the breeze tends to clock to the north, you
find better breeze and port lifts inshore. Once the wind gets to
the north, the left no longer pays. Watch for the wind to clock
further.
North Wind
Sail fast and bring your foul weather gear. Even in mid-
summer, the waves can stir up cold water. Try the right.
Northeast & East Wind
Get out into the lake for better breeze.
Southeast Wind
Go left, into the lake to fresher breeze and left shift.
South Wind
South wind bends near shore, for a SW shift near shore.
But the breeze may back as the south wind may be due to a
passing low or due to a building thermal blowing on shore. If
it is cloudy, go in. Clear? Sail Fast!

Newport Rhode Island Strategy Quiz Answer
Which way did you go?
The obvious answer is to go upwind in smooth water, and
downwind with the waves. That’s exactly what we did—this is
a true story—and we were wrong. People sailing in the waves
passed us while going upwind; and downwind we got passed
by boats sailing the smooth water while we surfed the waves.
Finally I realized the key factor was current. The tide was
going out, and it was creating the chop in the channel as it was
opposed to the wind. The correct strategy was to ride the cur-
rent upwind and avoid it downwind.
By the start of the next race I understood what was go-
ing on, and sailed into the channel to go upwind. Of course, by
then the tide had turned…

C HAPTER 8: U PWIND T ACTICS
8.1 Introduction
Tactics to Win
We work for years to develop competitive boat handling
and boat speed skills. Why? So we can enter the tactical game
in a position to win. With the foundation of our performance
pyramid taken care of, we can pick our head up out of the boat
and enter the world of tactics
Upwind tactics involve positioning against individuals or
groups of boats (Fig. 1) to take advantage of strategic conditions
(i.e. wind, shifts, and current), or to control tactical situations
(crossings and mark roundings). Over the course of a leg or race,
tactics become increasingly important. Early in a leg or race, it
is best to avoid confrontations and concentrate on a strategy that
will put you near the top. At the end of a leg, you battle tactically
to round ahead of those nearby. Toward the later stages of a race,
your general position is relatively fixed, and your efforts focus
on boats just ahead and just behind.
Tactics are relatively unimportant in mixed fleet races,
where you are racing the clock. In one-design or level rated
racing tactics predominate—as your closest rivals are the boats
nearby.
This chapter covers Upwind Tactics in nine sections. Fol-
lowing this introduction, Section Two looks at the impact of wind
shifts. Next, we consider tactical principles used for positioning
and control, followed by an explanation of how tactics change
over the course of a windward leg. Section Five looks at the
tactical weapons, and Section Six covers rules and their tactical
application. Section Seven describes one tacticians nightmare
while Section Eight tells why and how to eliminate tactics from
your racing! Finally, we offer a Quiz,and Tactics and Strategy
Skillbuilding ideas.
8.2 The Impact of Wind Shifts
Our strategy forms the framework for our tactics. We use
tactics to fulfill our strategic goals. One key element of strat-
egy is wind shifts, which we discussed in the previous chapter.
As we work to take advantage of shifts, we need to know their
tactical impact: How should we position ourselves against our
rivals in order to take advantage of the shifts, and what impact
do the shifts have?
LEP: Climb the Ladder
Sailing upwind is like climbing a ladder. The rungs of the
ladder hang perpendicular to the wind, and boats on the same
rung are equally far upwind. Each rung is called a line of equal
position—an LEP (Fig. 2a).

little for narrower tacking angles.

which are equally far upwind are on the same rung.

Strategy in Brief: Be Near the Shift
When the wind shifts, the ladder rotates. A boat closer to
the new wind gains—he is on a higher rung, and boats further
from the shift end up on a lower rung. The closer to the shift
you are, the further you are up the ladder and the less distance
you have to sail to get to the mark. Sail to the next shift.
Where have I heard that before? (Fig. 2b).
How Much do you Gain (or Lose) in a Shift?
The distances are staggering. When the wind shifts 10° the
boat closer to the shift gains 25% of the lateral distance sepa-
rating the boats.* For boats on the same LEP, and separated by
100 yards the gain is 25 yards. For boats separated by a greater
distance the gains/losses are greater** (Fig. 3).
For example, if two boats are separated by 848 feet the
gain/loss would be 212 feet. 848 feet of separation may seem
like a lot but consider……

Fig. 4 - After one minute of sailing time at six knots, boats are

……How Quickly it Happens
Imagine two boats sailing close hauled at a boat speed of
6 knots and tacking through 90°. They cross tacks, with the
port boat ducking. Each boat sails for one minute—you know,
sixty seconds. After one minute of sailing time, they will be
848 feet apart. A 10° shift will put one boat 212 feet ahead. At
six knots, that distance represents 21 seconds of sailing time.
Separating for 60 seconds creates a 20+ second gain/loss. Your
risk/reward on a 10° shift is one-third the time you spend split-
ting tacks with another boat (Fig. 4).
So, we were caught to the right when the wind shifted 10°
left. What should we do? And what about the boat that went
left, what should they do?
Well, we’ve missed that shift. The question is: What will
happen next? Strategically, we want to sail to the next shift, so
if the wind is going to go further left, we’d tack and go to it. If
the next shift is going to return to the right, then we’d keep go-
ing. That’s what strategy tells us. (Fig. 5)
Tactically, if we tack, we have given up these 212’. If
we hang on, and keep our 848’ of separation, then we can gain
it all back just as quickly as we lost it... just as quickly as the
wind returns where it was. We could even pull ahead if the
wind goes further right. What will the wind do?
If we tack we will be 212’ plus 2 boat lengths behind. If
we are one tenth of a knot faster, we’ll gain 10 feet per minute.
We could catch up in about 25 minutes, or gain back half the
loss in 12, and be close enough to get the rest on a small shift.
Assuming our rival tacks on the shift, continuing parallel
puts us no further behind – as long as the breeze doesn’t shift
further left. Let’s hang here, and look for a little righty to tack
on, or maybe a big righty. That would help.
Looking back, maybe we shouldn’t have separated so far.
But tacking would have cost us too, about two boat lengths,
and no way to recover those – they are spent.
Fig. 5 - Being unsure of what will happen next, the boat on the
right would most likely keep going, rather than tack on the lift,
and hope the wind would shift right, and erase the loss. The
boat on the left would likely tack to try to consolidate the gain.

When One Boat is Ahead
When one boat is ahead of another, results are similar.
Consider gains and losses as a percent of distance behind, from
LEP to LEP. We will consider three cases: the boat behind
will have leverage equal to the distance behind either toward
the shift (boat 1), or away from the shift (boat 2); or will be
straight downwind, with no leverage (boat 3). When the wind
shifts 10°, the boat closer to the shift gains 19%, the boat away
from the shift loses 16%, and surprisingly, the boat straight
downwind gains slightly—about 2% (Fig 6a).
When the boats are further separated, the gains and losses
increase. We use the term leverage to describe this lateral
separation. The further apart boats are, the more leverage they
have, and the more they stand to gain or lose in a shift. A boat
which is behind will pull even with the leader in a 10° shift if
his leverage is 5.7 times the distance behind (boat 4) (and if
the shift is to his side). That may seem like a lot of separation,
but as we saw earlier, leverage builds fast when you split tacks.
In a bigger shift less leverage is needed to catch up, or to fall
twice as far behind! ( Fig. 6b).
WOW!
Through all numbers and examples, one point stands out:
wind shifts are a big deal. As I said before, the potential gains/
losses are staggering.

The Message
Wind shifts are a big deal. We got that message.
Two corollaries follow:
First, if you can predict the next shift, sail to it.
Second, if you don’t know what to expect, then minimize
leverage to minimize the impact of shifts. (Have you ever been
unable to anticipate the next shift? Me neither, and the check is
in the mail.) 	(Fig. 7).
We’ll look at these two corollaries from two perspectives:
catching up when you are behind, and protecting a lead when
you are ahead.
Catching Up
When you’re unsure of the next shift, minimize lever-
age by staying in the low risk zone. Try to nibble away at the
leaders with speed while eliminating the risk due to shifts.
By minimizing leverage, you deny the leaders the chance to
stretch the lead, and you stay within striking distance. Then,
when you can predict an upcoming shift, go to it. Remember
how quickly leverage grows; you don’t need to split for long if
you’ve stayed within striking distance.
Splitting with the leaders just for the sake of splitting is
a bad risk. Since the leaders are usually going the right way
(Hint: they are in the lead), you are more likely to fall further
behind than to catch up. Stay close and wait for an opportu-
nity. Split only when the odds are in your favor. (Fig. 8).
Staying Ahead
You hear this said about champions: He gets ahead, and he
is gone. How do they do it?
About other racers you may hear: Don’t worry about him,
eventually he’ll go to pieces. Why?
Tactical dogma when in the lead is stay between the com-
petition and the next mark. Cover ‘em and you can’t lose.
When you’re in the lead, it is not enough to simply stay
between the competition and the mark. 	If you are looking
back, and just reacting, then those behind can get leverage and
eat away at your lead.
Fig. 8 – When you are behind, splitting
tacks with the leaders is usually NOT
a good way to catch up. If the leaders
are going the right way, then splitting
and going the wrong way just leaves
you further behind.

(or lose) on a wind shift. If you can predict the next shift, sail
to it. When in doubt, minimize leverage.

Fig. 9 – To stay in front, you can’t
just cover. You have to keep doing
the things that got you there. Lead
to the shifts; don’t simply tack in
response to the trailing boat’s tack.
Keep the Initiative
Real leaders continue to lead. To keep the lead, you must
keep the initiative. Sail fast, hit the shifts, and do the things
you did to get the lead. Pay attention to those behind you, yes;
but think in terms of stretching the lead and adding a cushion
rather than simply going into a defensive shell and sitting on
the lead you’ve got. You certainly don’t want to split with the
fleet, but you have to do more than look back and cover. The
true champions pay attention to the fleet behind them; but they
keep working, keep hitting the shifts, keep looking ahead. (I’ve
yet to test this myself, but I’m ready to give it a try). (Fig. 9).
All too often, sailors change their tactics once in the lead,
and lose the initiative. Maybe you’ve experienced this. You
kick and scratch and fight your way to the lead. Once you get
there, you start to shake, you feel queasy, and your look back
instead of ahead. Take a deep breath, and keep plugging.
When you’re sailing with a comfortable lead, proper po-
sitioning can help protect it. If the next shift or the mark is to
the left, then position yourself to protect your left. Use a loose
cover (details below) and don’t let trailing boats get enough
leverage to threaten your lead.
Wind Shift Prospectus
Playing shifts carries inherent risks. While much can
be gained, one should not lose sight of the risks involved. Be
aware that past shift performance is not a guarantee of future
shifts. Read the prospectus in full before leveraging.
The gains made on shifts can be fleeting. While you
may gain on the shift, the gain is not realized until you tack
on the shift and cross between the wind and your rivals. Until
the gain is realized, it can vanish as quickly as it appeared.
Tacking to consolidate your gains is a transaction cost – think
of a good tack as a form of discount brokerage.
When behind, splitting tacks with the leaders is not
always sound strategy. While you may gain on a wind shift,
you are at least as likely to lose, as the leaders are (more often
than not) going the right way. They are, after all, in the lead.
The prudent tactician will not split tacks on a whim in
hope of getting lucky; but will sail fast, and go the same way
as the leaders when the leaders are going the right way in or-
der to stay within striking distance. Then, when an opportuni-
ty arises to catch a shift the leaders miss, the prudent tactician
will still be close enough to catch up. Remember, you can get
plenty of leverage in a hurry (if you are not too far behind), so
stay close, sail fast, be patient, and look for your opportunity.
When you do get a chance to split or lead to a shift, don’t
get greedy. Rather than try to catch up all at once, sometimes
it is better to just get closer. Gain back half the distance,
rather than push too far and suffer a reversal as the shift dis-
solves.
Boatspeed, while offering less immediate rewards, can
provide a more consistent and reliable return with less risk.
Boatspeed remains entirely within your control, unlike wind
shifts, which are subject to the vagaries of the weather.
A mixed portfolio of competitive tools has historically
provided the most consistent results.

There are a number of general tactical principles to keep
in mind as you sail upwind. The overall objective—your up-
wind strategy—should remain the priority. Use tactics to help
you achieve that goal.
Keep Clear Air & Freedom
Keep control of your own destiny. Avoid situations where
other boats can control you. You need to look ahead and posi-
tion yourself clear of crowds.
Cross When You Can
This is also called consolidating your lead. If you wait,
conditions may change, and you may lose your opportunity
(Fig. 10).
Don’t Let Others Cross You
When the wind shifts, don’t let those who gain consoli-
date. Go to the next shift and recoup. By staying off to the side,
ahead and to leeward, a favorable shift will help you (Fig. 11).
The catch is that you have to be going the right way. If the
shifts are large and difficult to anticipate, you run the risk of
being buried if the shift works against you. When things get
weird, it may be best to position yourself with the leaders until
you can sort things out; then use the Catching Up ideas from
the previous section.
Stay Toward the Middle
A championship tactic, which sometimes doesn’t work for
the rest of us who spend most of our time in the middle of the
fleet. When you are in the lead, or near it, adhere to this rule, as
it minimizes leverage for those behind and gives you the ability
to go either way to protect your position, to clear your air when
attacked, and to pursue shifts. (Fig. 12).
Back where most of the fleet does most of their sailing,
the traffic and disturbed air of the middle can be devastating.
Yes, sail the middle when you can; but balance this with con-
cerns for clear air and the search for favorable shifts.
When one side of the course is heavily favored, then the
middle moves with the fleet. The middle is the middle of the

Chapter 8: Upwind Tactics 	Page 93
Fig. 12 – Sailing up the middle allows you to
play the shifts and cover the fl eet; but the middle
can be pretty messy if you aren’t near the front.
Then you might have to pick a side.
Fig. 13 – Once you reach the
layline, you run out of options. You
are vulnerable to attack, and the
shifts no longer help you.
Fig. 14 – Don’t split with the fl eet. If
the fl eet is going the right way, then
splitting only leaves you further behind.
it better. When you are on the favored side, there is no need to
split. Just stay on the favored side of the fleet.
The real application for this principle is sailing to a fa-
vored side when you are behind. It is true that you can’t win by
following, but tacking away will only make matters worse. Un-
til the leaders make a mistake, you won’t catch ‘em. Hang on
even if it hurts, and stay close. Tacking away from the favored
side or a persistent shift is not the answer. You’ll get a chance
to fight back if you stay close, and you’ll get hammered if you
go the wrong way. Rather than tack and follow, lead the fleet
to the next shift – if you can find it. (Fig. 14).
fleet, really. When the entire fleet goes left, the middle goes left
with the fleet.
Avoid the Laylines
Once you hit the layline, you are out of options. You are
subject to attack, and you are hurt by any shift (Fig. 13).
Avoiding the laylines is a good principle, with few excep-
tions. The most notable exception is in the middle of a huge
fleet. First, you will be forced out of the middle by traffic.
Then, as you approach the mark, the turbulence and disturbed
air between the laylines must be avoided; often by sailing a few
boat lengths beyond the layline to get clear air. Until you have
approached the windward mark 52nd in a fleet of 63, you don’t
know how bad bad air can be.
Stay With the Fleet
When you are ahead, stay with those behind you. No sur-
prise here. Sail the same breeze as those around you; just sail

the long leg fi rst.
Fig. 15 – Lead the crowd by tacking
ahead and to leeward.
Fig. 16 – When in front, cover by staying
between the fl eet and the next shift.
Cover When Ahead
Stay between the fleet and the next shift. If you are ahead
and can anticipate the next shift, sail to it. If you are ahead, you
have to hit the shifts to stay ahead. Your lead won’t last long if
you follow the fleet into the shifts (Fig. 16).
Stay between the fleet and the next mark. If you can’t find
the next shift, find the mark and protect your position that way.
Lead the fleet toward the mark or shift.
Sometimes you can’t cover. There are times when it sim-
ply does not pay to cover. When conditions become dramatical-
ly shifty, the impulse is to cover tightly. But in these conditions
it can prove impossible to cover an opponent. Concentrate on
sailing your own race. Try to keep your cool when things get
weird.
One-Legged Beats
When the course is skewed by a major wind shift so you
can nearly fetch the windward mark, you are sailing a one-
legged beat. Tactically, the best position is ahead and to lee-
Lead the Crowd
As you approach a crowd of boats, tack ahead and to
leeward, rather than sail through the crowd to their hip. There
are a number of reasons why this works. First, it is best to stay
with the fleet, as mentioned above. Second, if the crowd is
sailing toward the next shift, then you will be the first to get it.
Third, once you sail into a crowd you may have trouble finding
clear air or a tacking lane. Fourth, if you decide you want to get
across to the outside, you can tack again and exercise that op-
tion later. Once you cross the crowd, you can’t reconsider and
return to the ahead and to leeward position.
This principle is particularly powerful if you can lead the
crowd toward the middle of the course. On the other hand, you
may want to abandon this principle if crossing the crowd will
get you to the inside of the group, closer to the middle. From a
position on the inside hip, you are ready to lead the fleet to the
middle as they tack that way (Fig. 15).

-- 101 of 191 --

Chapter 8: Upwind Tactics 	Page 95
Get Blockers To Protect You
You’re on port, and you’re getting ready to tack. You look
over your shoulder and see a crowd on your hip. You need a
blocker (a boat ahead and to leeward) to shield you from the
crowd (Fig. 19). A blocker will take all the heat (lee bows etc.)
as you sail into the crowd. A boat you can just cross makes an
excellent blocker. After you cross, sail two lengths and tack.
Now your blocker will lead you through. Anyone who can
cross the blocker can cross you. Boats which might normally
create a problem for you run into the blocker first. You sail on
without interference.
Hidden boat trick!
Watch for this: Two starboard-tack boats are approaching
a port-tack boat. The leeward starboard boat waves the port
tacker by, “Go ahead.” Imagine the port tack boat’s surprise
when he sees another starboard tacker previously hidden from
view! (Fig. 20).
ward. If the leg is a port fetch, try to avoid a clearing tack to
starboard when you round the leeward mark. On a starboard
fetch, try to tack immediately at the mark.
From the ahead and to leeward position, you have greater
control and better opportunities in wind shifts. If you are lifted
you may fetch; and if you are headed, you will be able to tack
and cross those on your hip.
If you sail the short leg first, then you will quickly find
yourself in the corner with few options (Fig. 17).
More Tactical Ideas
Anticipate
When you’re on port tack, sailing on the hip of another
port-tack boat, plan how you will react if he tacks. Will you
tack or duck? Your response depends on a number of tactical
and strategic factors. Don’t wait for the other boat to tack to de-
cide your response (Fig. 18).

blocker. Cross him and tack. Others will have
to deal with him fi rst, leaving you free.

8.4 Up the Beat in 3 Stages
Tactics upwind is a matter of positioning for wind shifts
and positioning for control. We can divide the beat into three
segments. The initial segment is the period after the start or
leeward mark rounding when we are sailing in a crowd and
fighting for clear air. The middle segment starts when we break
out of the crowd and are free to pursue strategy. The final seg-
ment is the battle for position approaching the windward mark.
Boat-to-boat battles predominate at the beginning and end of
the leg, while wind shifts are the focus in the middle segment
(Fig. 21).
Fig. 21 – The windward leg can be divided into three
tactical segments: the initial segment, the beat, and the
rounding.
The Initial Segment: Positioning for Freedom
The priorities during the first part of any beat are to keep
clear air and to have the freedom to pursue your strategy. The
first few minutes after a start, as discussed earlier, are critical;
any advantage gained there will be magnified.
At the beginning of subsequent beats, the goal is to catch
the first shift and get to work on strategy. If the goal is to work
to the right, it may be necessary to tack shortly after rounding
and then tack back when a clear lane to the right is available.
If you are outside at the rounding, you may be able to reach
through for clear air and save two tacks (Fig. 22).
If the strategy is to go left, then you must work to be free
to tack after the rounding. Beware the wind shadow and tur-
bulence of boats which have yet to round and are still on the
previous leg. While you will have right of way close hauled

on starboard, there may still be reason to delay a tack until you
can clear that hazard (Fig. 23).
The Beat: Strategy Reigns
The middle segment starts once you are clear of the
crowds at the start or leeward mark and continues until you
start working for position at the windward mark. Tactics on this
segment focus on the freedom to pursue your strategy.
The tactical principles discussed above come into play
during this segment. The overall objective—your upwind
strategy—should remain the priority. Use tactics to help you
achieve that goal.
Course Management is the term used to summarize your
efforts up the beat. The challenge is to look ahead, and an-
ticipate developments. When your strategy suggests one side
is favored, good course management means finding a lane of
clear air so you can get to the favored side with good speed.
Course management comes in to play as you get to the
favored side, and must once again find a clear lane from the fa-
vored side to the mark. Looking ahead, work the favored side
as hard as you can, but tack before you are forced all the way
to the outside of the crowd. Better to tack early – you can tack
out again later if you want – than to get pushed to the outside
(Fig. 24).
As the fleet converges on the mark clear air is harder to
come by. Coming in on port provides clear air – at the risk on
being frozen out on the layline (Fig. 25).
The rounding segment is next.

beyond.

Fig. 26 – Sail into the last
oscillation going into the mark as

The Rounding: Positioning for Control
Approaching the weather mark, work for control of those
nearby. Keep clear air, and try to keep from being pinned by
others. With marks to port, the left side is inside at the round-
ing, but a boat on the right controls the last starboard crossing.
Starboard roundings put a premium on controlling the right, as
the right owns both the inside position and the last starboard
crossing.
The Last Oscillation Is A Persistent Shift
In an oscillating breeze, treat the last shift before the mark
as a persistent shift. That is, sail the header to the layline, then
tack for the lift. Any leg which has just one shift should be
sailed as you would in a persistent shift. Think of the last part
of the leg as a very short leg with just one shift (Fig. 26).
Inside the Laylines
Inside the laylines, a weather quarter position gives
control, as a boat on the lee bow is pinned and not free to tack.
This position must be carried all the way to the layline or it will
be reversed if both boats tack.
A port-starboard crossing near the layline is a common
situation which offers many options and counter options.
If the port-tack boat can cross, he has several choices. He
can cross and continue on port tack toward the starboard layline;
he can tack to lee bow or cover the starboard tacker, giving the
starboard tacker incentive to tack away; or he can tack to pin the
starboard tacker and carry out to the port layline (Fig. 27).
If the port tacker cannot cross, then he can tack or duck.
If he chooses to tack, he may be pinned out until the starboard
boat tacks. A well-executed duck creates an opportunity for a
reversal at the next crossing. To prevent a reversal, the star-
board tack boat can tack and pin the port boat. If the starboard

tacker is not prepared or fails to execute properly, then he will
not be able to prevent a reversal (Fig. 28)
If the port-tack boat sails to the starboard tack layline, then
the starboard tacker (now coming in on port) may be able to lee
bow and lead to the mark. If the port tacker tacks short of the
layline, then we have a reversal of our earlier situation. Go back
one paragraph. Do not round the mark. Do not collect $200.
On the Laylines
On the layline, a lee bow position is preferred; just don’t
fail to fetch the mark.
If the starboard tacker is on the layline, a port tacker can
tack ahead, or on the lee bow, to round ahead of the starboard
tacker. If there is doubt about whether or not the starboard
tacker will fetch, it is best to cross and tack to weather, using
the starboard tacker as a blocker against those coming into the
layline later (Fig. 29).
If there is a crowd on the layline, tack away and come back
later, rather than sail extra distance or in bad air at the layline.
Once you go to the layline and duck the crowd, you concede (for
that leg). By tacking out, you give yourself one more chance—at
the risk of losing others if the layline fills (Fig. 30).
Bail Out Early
You’re on the layline. Almost. Just a little shy of the
layline maybe, but you can pinch up and make it. Maybe. Stop
kidding yourself and bail out now.
If you bail out early, there may still be room on the layline
to get back in line. If you wait until later to flop to port, it may
be too late. You will end up ducking the entire fleet before you
find a space on the layline.
If you are approaching the mark in clear air and no turbu-
lence, you might be able to pinch up and make it; but if there
are other boats on your air then bail out early (Fig. 31).

8.5 Tactical Weapons
Our upwind strategy gives us the big picture, and our
tactical principles guide us as we confront groups of boats.
Tactical weapons are the tools we use to put the principles into
practice and achieve our strategic goals. Broadly speaking,
there are two general categories: Those that allow us to control
and influence others, and those which allow us to prevent oth-
ers from doing the same to us.
As we look at tactical weapons, we will discuss what each
does and how it is used.
Controlling other Boats
Tight Cover
A tight cover is a an aggressive move which slows an ad-
versary by putting the him in your wind shadow. A tight cover
necessitates a response. Use a tight cover when you want to
force another boat away (Fig. 32).
To put it another way: You should tack and cover only if
it would be time to tack anyhow, even if the other boat weren’t
there. You use a tight cover when you want to go the way they
were going, and want to force them to go the way you were go-
ing, which suggests that maybe you were going the wrong way
to begin with...
Tack so you are directly upwind after accelerating or the
rival may escape your shadow (Fig. 33).
Loose Cover
A loose cover is a course parallel to the opponent(s) which
does not put the other boat(s) in our wind shadow. A loose
cover is more defensive than a tight cover. A loose cover does
not impede the progress of the other boat(s). It puts you in a
position where you can protect your lead (Fig. 34).
Your intent with a loose cover is to deny your opponent
the opportunity to sail different conditions than you are sailing.
A tight cover, on the other hand, often forces your opponent to
tack away. The danger with a tight cover is that your opponent
then separates from you, and may find more favorable condi-
tions.

< Fig. 35 – Do Not tack and cover
someone when you are going the
right way and they are going the
wrong way.
>> Fig. 37 – A pin prevents the
outside boat from tacking until the
inside boat tacks.
> Fig. 36 – You can herd a boat
with a tight cover on one tack and a
loose cover on the other tack.
Herding
Herding is any technique which encourages other boats to
go the same way you are going. Hmm. Why would you want to
do that? And how would you do it?
You herd other boats along when you are fearful of what
may happen if they get away. If you are uncertain of what the
wind shifts will do, you want to stay near others to minimize
your risk.
There are two basic ways to herd another boat. The first
uses a series of tight covers on one tack and loose covers on
the other tack. This encourages the opponent to sail the loosely
covered tack (Fig. 36). The second is with a pin, which is de-
scribed below.
Pin
A pin is a tack into position on another boat’s hip which
prevents the opponent from tacking away. It is used approach-
ing a layline, where you can prevent your opponent from tack-
ing to the mark until you do. It is also useful when herding one
boat back toward a pack you want to cover (Fig. 37).
When you are unsure of what to expect next with the
wind, a loose cover lets you sail near your opponent.
Go Ahead and Cover
If you are ready to tack but delay for a moment, you can
dump bad air on an opponent close behind. This frustrates the
opponent, as he must now tack away or sail in bad air. Given
the chance, you can be sure he will return the favor.
The assumption is that you would be tacking anyhow, for
strategic reasons, and take the opportunity to force the rival to
sail the wrong way.
The Sucker Cover
You are crossing a close rival and tack on his air. You
hadn’t planned to tack, but couldn’t pass up the opportunity to
face on your rival. Trouble is, you were going the right way,
towards a shift perhaps. Now you have traded places. You are
going the wrong way, and you have forced your rival to go
where you wanted to go. Sucker.
Don’t lose sight of your strategy as you play tactical
games (Fig. 35).
No!

Fig. 38 – A Slam Dunk is used by a
starboard-tack boat to pin a port tacker.
It doesn’t always work.
Fig. 40 – A tack directly in front of
another boat will push the rival back.
Slam Dunk
The Slam Dunk is a technique for pinning a port-tack boat
after he ducks a starboard-tack boat. Immediately after the port
tacker ducks, the starboard boat tacks.
The Slam Duck often does not work. The Slam Dunk is a
good way to pin a rival out to the starboard tack layline if it is
not too far away, but over time the leeward boat can often gas
off the windward boat (Fig. 38).
Using Your Wind Shadow
You can slow another boat by positioning your wind
shadow on him. Once in your wind shadow, the opponent can
either sail slowly or tack away.
From Directly Upwind
The simplest way to attack another boat is to position
yourself directly upwind. This is the epitome of a tight cover.
When tacking into this position, remember that you want to be
directly upwind after you finish your tack and regain speed. It
is common for attacking boats to tack too late and let the target
boat break through (Fig. 39).
From Ahead
Another effective position for attack is directly in line
with the opponent. The turbulence off your sails will foul the
air for a several boat lengths off your stern. To assure that your
opponent cannot escape your wind shadow without tacking,
aim for a position between directly upwind and ahead (Fig. 40).
From the Lee Bow
As the name suggests, a lee bow position is on the leeward
bow of an opponent. Boats create a surprising amount of tur-
bulence to windward. Tacking ahead and to leeward can have a
devastating effect (Fig. 41).
When you tack on a lee bow, be sure you have proper
position. You must be nearly a full boat length ahead in order to
lee bow properly; otherwise the opponent will squeeze up and
put you in a pin; or worse, he may even roll you and force you
to tack again (Fig. 42).
Fig. 39 – Tack into a position on top of
another boat to put them in your wind
shadow.

Fig. 41 – A tack on a rival’s lee bow
necessitates a response.
Fig. 43 – When you are attacked, you can try
to keep clear air by driving off to leeward.
Fig. 42 – If the weather boat can squeeze
up, the lee bow boat will be pinned.
Defending Yourself
The defence from attack is anticipation and quick re-
sponse. In order to survive an attack, you must break through
to clear air before the attacker has reached full speed. Once the
attacker is up to speed, it is nearly impossible to break clear.
Squeeze Up to Windward
If an opponent tacks on your lee bow, you may be able to
escape by pinching up into clear air. React as soon as you are
attacked. Once you fall into the attacker’s exhaust, performance
will suffer and you will not be able escape (Fig. 42).
If the attacker’s position is strong, tack out as soon as pos-
sible, before the attack impacts your ability to tack and escape
smoothly.
Drive Through to Leeward
If a boat tacks on your air, you can either tack away im-
mediately or try to drive through to leeward to clear air. If you
anticipate the attack, you can prepare to respond. If you want
to stay on your present tack, then reach off slightly as soon as
the attacker crosses your bow. With a little extra speed and a
slightly late tack by the opponent, you may be able to break
through in front of his wind shadow (Fig. 43).
If you plan to tack away, then do so immediately. Start
your clearing tack while you still have full speed to minimize
the hurt.
Don’t Tack into a Pin
When tacking to leeward of a boat or boats, do so with
enough room to be free to tack back should the need arise.
Don’t hand a rival boat the power to decide when you will next
be free to tack.
Sucker Cover
If you are preparing to tack and see a rival coming, you
may want to delay your tack for two reasons. One is to avoid
tacking into a pin. The other is to tempt the rival to tack on you
(and presumably sail off in the wrong direction) while you tack
as planned (presumably going the right way). See earlier Figure
35 for Sucker Cover, but now you are the other guy!

Wave ‘em By
A port tacker who may or may not cross you can become a
real nuisance if he throws in a last second lee bow tack. If you
want to continue on starboard, wave ‘em by, even if you have
to duck a little bit. Anything to encourage him to keep going
the wrong way and stay out of your way (Fig. 44).
Ducking and Reversal
You’re on port tack, and you are approaching a star-
board-tack boat. You have five options: Cross, lee bow, cross
and tack, tack, or duck (Fig. 45). Your selection depends on
whether or not you can cross, and which way you want to go. If
you can cross, go ahead. Or lee bow, as detailed in Figure 41. If
you can cross, and you are unsure which way to go, then cross
and tack to put your opponent in a loose cover. If you can’t
cross, then tack or duck–what would you do in the absence of
the other boat? If you decide to tack, try not to tack into a pin.
Otherwise, duck.
Fig. 44 – If you are going the right way, wave a
port tacker by, even if you have to duck a little.
Fig. 45 – When in doubt, duck. 	Fig. 46 – Make a smooth turn and
carry speed as you trim up.
Take a Bearing
You can tell if you will cross by taking a bearing from
your stern to the starboard boat’s bow. If the bearing is increas-
ing, you will cross.
If there is doubt about crossing, then duck. Don’t forfeit
the race with a protest. And don’t wait for the last instant to
decide. A good smooth duck costs little. A poor duck or a crash
tack can be a disaster.
Here’s How it Works: As you approach it looks close.
“Let’s duck.” Wave to the starboard tack boat so they know you
see them. No need to yell. From a few lengths, ease your main
and jib slightly and bear off. Aim for the spot where the star-
board boat will be as you pass. A boat length away, your bow
will be pointed at his. He’ll sail a boat length, and you’ll pass
smartly under his stern. Well, maybe don’t aim exactly at his
bow, but you get my drift.
As you pass under his stern you want to be going faster
than your close-hauled speed (after reaching off), but you
want to be trimmed up to close hauled again. You must ease to

fill the old foe is safely behind, in your wind shadow, unnerved,
confused, and sailing badly (Fig. 48a).
Or #2: He may cross. No, he can’t. He decides to duck,
no, tack. Yes, duck. He pulls the helm up under his chin, but
the boat hardly responds. The jib sheet is thrown off. “I thought
you said tack.” After a nervous moment the rudder grabs and
the boat pivots down to a broad reach, sailing nearly parallel to
you. Passing under your stern on a reciprocal course, they head
the wrong way, finally coming to course about 2 boat lengths to
leeward. The jib comes in slowly (Fig. 48b).
Or #3: He may cross. No, he can’t. He decides to duck,
no, tack. Yes, duck. He pulls the helm up under his chin, but
the boat hardly responds. The main has not been eased and
the boat won’t bear off. He hits you amidships, just behind the
shrouds, and takes a big chunk out of your port rail. The only
thing bigger than the hole in your rail are their eyes (Fig. 48c).
In order to achieve a reversal, you must duck properly.
Look ahead and be ready to react.
Fig. 48a,b,c - Three things to avoid: The crash tack, The “OH!
My God” duck, and The Starboard Tack Boat’s Cockpit.	Fig. 47 – With a good duck, when you tack the
next time you will be on starboard—and ahead!
build speed when you bear off, but don’t wait until you have
passed to trim up again. Repeat: faster than close-hauled and
trimmed all the way as you pass under his stern. You get a lift
from the air off his sails. Pinch up in it and work to weather. If
you’re lucky, you’ll even be able to surf out on his stern wave
(Fig. 46).
You sail fast, and eventually you tack. Your opponent
tacks too. You come together; only this time you’re on star-
board. You give him a wave. Theoretically he will cross you by
the margin of your duck. Too close to call. Not only that, but
you were going faster than full speed as you passed under his
stern. You made up some of the distance. He can’t cross. He’ll
duck … no, tack …. he can’t decide (Fig. 47).
Here’s how it doesn’t work #1: He may cross. No, he
can’t. He decides to duck, no, tack. He throws the helm down.
The crew are caught by surprise. The jib backs before it is
finally released. It luffs on the new tack. No one was ready.
There was no warning. Finally the jib is trimmed. As the sails

Opposite Tacks (Rule 10)
The next time you are on port tack in a close crossing con-
sider this: Racing sailors would rather have their house burn
down than crash their boat. After all, the family can always
sleep on the boat; but if they crash their boat, they can’t race
the house. The guy on starboard is not going to risk crashing
his boat to prove that you could cross. If it is close, he will bear
off and protest. Don’t risk it. Duck instead (Fig. 49).
While Rule 10 gives Starboard the Right of Way, Rule
16.1 limits the right of way boat to require that if she changes
course she must provide the keep clear boat with room to keep
clear. Furthermore, Rule 16.2 provides that if a Port boat is
ducking then the Starboard boat cannot change course is a way
that requires an immediate change so course by Port. (Fig. 50).
8.6 Rules Upwind
There are only four Right of Way Rules in the entire Rule
Book: Rule 10 – On Opposite Tacks, Rule 11 – Same Tack,
Overlapped, Rule 12 – Same Tack, Not Overlapped, and Rule
13 – While Tacking . The Mark Room and Obstruction rules of
Section C also come into play upwind.
It is difficult to survive a protest. If you scare someone
and raise their blood pressure when tacking or crossing, they
can protest you and throw you out. The same applies if you get
someone angry.
There are two common ways to get in trouble: Greed
and surprise, both of which can cloud good judgment. Don’t
be greedy (wishing you could cross is not sufficient) and look
ahead to avoid surprises.
Fig. 49 – When on port, don’t expect a
starboard tacker to risk crashing his boat!
Fig. 50 – Rule 10 gives starboard the right of way.
Rule 16.1 requires that if Starboard changes course, she give
Port room to keep clear. Furthermore, under Rule 16.2, if Port
is ducking then Starboard cannot change course in a way that
requires an immediate change of course by Port.

Obstructions (Rules 19 and 20)
When two (or more) port tack boats approach a starboard-
tack boat, the port tackers must stay clear. The starboard-tack
boat ranks as an obstruction. The port-tack boats may duck or
tack in order to keep clear. The leeward port tacker may choose
to duck and give others room to duck as well, or he may choose
to tack (Fig. 52).
If the leeward boat chooses to tack, Rule 20 requires that
he hail the boat) to windward. The windward boat must tack, or
hail “You tack,” and stay clear. The leeward boat must tack as
soon as he gets a response (either action or words).
Windward Mark Roundings
The mark rounding rules at the windward mark differ from
those on a free leg of the course. There are three basic situa-
tions:
Fig. 51 – You have tacked too close if the trailing boat must
start evasive maneuvers before you fi nish your turn.
Fig. 52 – Two port boats must stay
clear of a starboard obstruction.
Same Tack, Overlapped (Rule 11)
Windward boats must stay clear. With everyone sailing
close hauled, the windward/ leeward rules are not as volatile
upwind as they are downwind; but windward boats must still
be careful. Even if your boat is not as close winded (doesn’t
point as high) as a leeward boat, you must stay clear.
While Tacking (Rule 13) and Same Tack, Not
Overlapped (Rule 12)
After crossing head to wind, the tacking boat must com-
plete her tack (finish turning and be on course) before the right-
of-way boat initiates an evasive maneuver, or she has tacked
too close. If it comes to a protest, then not only must you tack
legally, you must also be able to prove it. Be careful (Fig. 51).
If a rival tacks in front of you then you must avoid hitting
them from astern. Alter course to avoid a collision. If you must
alter course before the tacking boat has completed her tack, she
has fouled you. Avoid a collision and protest.

1) Both boats on starboard tack, leaving the mark to
port, (or both on port, mark to starboard).
This is both a windward/ leeward or clear ahead/ clear
astern and a Mark Room situation. The boat to leeward or
ahead has right of way, and also receives Mark Room. She
may luff to round the mark (this is proper course). The other
boat must keep clear (Fig. 53).
2) One boat on starboard, one on port. Regular Right of
Way rules apply. There is no Mark Room for boats on opposite
tacks at a windward mark (See Rule 18.1 b). At a port round-
ing, the port tacker must stay clear (Fig. 54).
If a port-tack boat tacks to starboard inside the three boat
length zone, then Rule 18.3 applies. If the starboard boat must
head up above close hauled to avoid the tacking boat, the tack-
ing boat has violated the rule. Furthermore, if the starboard
boat overlaps the tacking boat to the inside, the tacking boat
must give room. (Fig. 55).
The burdens on a boat tacking inside the zone are so oner-
ous that I suggest you don’t do it, and consider one of three
options:
• Come in right on the layline and tack around the mark,
minimizing your exposure. (Fig. 56 – option 1).
• Don’t tack – Cross the starboard boat (if you can) and
then tack. 	(Fig. 56 – option 2).
• Come in more than three lengths from the mark and com-
plete your tack outside the zone. 	(Fig. 56 – option 3).
3) Two boats on port tack. When two port tackers ap-
proach a mark to be left to port, (or two starboard tackers for a
starboard rounding), the Mark Room rules apply. The outside
boat must give the inside boat room, including room to tack.
(Fig.57a)
If the boats are not overlapped then the clear ahead boat
gets Mark Room, but this does not include room to tack. A boat
clear ahead must obey Rule 13: While Tacking when she tacks
around the mark. (See Definition of Mark Room). (Fig. 57b).
Fig. 54 – The starboard boat has right of
way. There is no buoy room.
Fig. 53 – The inside, leeward boat is
entitled to room and has right of way.

Penalty.
Fig. 58 – With marks to
starboard, the port boat

Marks To Starboard
The mark rounding rules are the same when marks are
to starboard, but they do not work as cleanly. At a starboard
rounding, the starboard tacker has right of way while on
course, but is not entitled to tack in a port tacker’s path. The
port tacker must stall, duck, or tack away while the starboard
tack boat crosses ahead. The situation gets unruly during a
crowded starboard rounding (Fig. 58).
Hitting The Mark (Rule 31)
A boat which hits a mark must immediately get clear of other
boats and do a One-Turn Penalty before proceeding. While doing
a penalty turn, a boat has no rights and must stay clear of all other
boats. If the boat was wrongfully pushed into the mark, she may
proceed, but she must protest the offending boat (Fig. 59).
< Fig. 56 – The burdens of Rule 18.3 are
such that you should avoid tacking inside the
3 length zone. Try tacking around the mark,
crossing, and then tacking, or tacking outside
the zone.

8.7 A Tactician’s Nightmare
There are a number of classic situations which make tacti-
cians toss and turn. Here’s one example:
Persistent or Oscillating
We were out early before the start, and got great data. The
wind graph shows oscillations, and we’ve been playing them
like a fiddle. Up the first beat we hit every shift. We held the
lead downwind, and now we’ve turned upwind again.
Pretty much the same numbers as the first beat, so we’re
hitting the shifts as before. On starboard now, and lifted.
Stretching out our advantage. 	A little more lift now, and we
are beaming. We’ve hit the big one. More big gains while
some out-of-phase rivals sail off headed.
More lift, and the first hints of paranoid fear infect our
glee. The big lift holds, and we start to wonder if it will ever
go back. A slight header, and we start to think about tacking,
even though we are still lifted compared to average for the day,
but before we can act the big lift returns.
Genuine concern now. Have conditions changed? Are we
now on the outside of a persistent shift – sailing away from the
shift on the Great Circle Route? Or will the oscillations return?
What should we do? Tack and take our medicine? Hang on
and look for at least a bit of a header to go back on? (Fig. 60).
I wish I had the answer for this one. The best I can offer
are ideas:
• Look ahead, and look at the sky. Have things heated
up? Clouds moved in or out? Any clues from boats
further upwind, or to the sides?
• Review the forecast. What did we expect?
• Where’s the fleet? Our risk is measured in leverage. If
our rivals are going our way, then the risk is small. If
they’ve split, then the risk is great. If they are going
both ways...
Rules, Ethics, and Self Interest
The rules upwind are straightforward, much more so
than at starts or offwind marks. Protests are usually the result
of greed or surprise which cloud your judgment. Don’t get
greedy—be ready to duck if you can’t cross cleanly, and look
ahead to avoid surprises.
And when you foul someone, acknowledge the foul and
take your penalty.
When you have the right of way, you need not protest ev-
ery offense. You can protest a close port/ starboard; but you can
also hail the offender, “You owe me one.” In the long run, your
own interests will be better served if you don’t protest unless
your performance suffers. If you protest even when the port
boat might have made it, you will probably win the protest. He
will be thrown out, and he will doubtless look for a chance to
return the favor.
By the same token, you have an obligation to protest a
gross offense. If you are badly fouled by a port tack boat, you
owe it to the rest of the fleet to protest. Otherwise you are con-
doning cheating. Ideally the port boat will withdraw or take a
penalty without forcing you to follow through with a protest.
But if people don’t play by the rules then they are not
playing the game.

• One option is to tack and talk. Rather than
continue, tack over and see how the other
tack feels while we assess long term strat-
egy.
• Focus on speed and tactics. Reduce risk by
consolidating with the fleet, and sail fast.
• Tack! Face it – conditions have changed, and
this is a persistent shift. Bail out now. As bad
as things seem now, it will only get worse.
• Don’t tack! Hang on. Don’t panic. The wind
will come back. The only thing more painful than
being caught on the outside of a persistent shift is
tacking, sailing headed, and then having the wind
(finally) shift back so we have to tack and sail
headed again. Not only are we in the tank, but our
old neighbors who stuck it out on the original lift
are far ahead. Aarrrgh.
There is no easy answer here, but a strategic theme
bears repeating: When unsure of what the wind will do,
then minimize the impact of shifts by minimizing leverage.
Another theme: While we sort things out, sail the tack that
takes us closer to the mark.
Fig. 60 – When conditions change mid-race, tacticians have
to scramble to revise strategy. When oscillating shifts turn
into persistent shifts (or is it just a longer oscillations – who
knows?) you can be left scratching your head.

Fig. 61 - Tactics and Strategy require us to make the most of
the unknown. The more we can rely on our boat handling and
boat speed, the less we will have to rely on things we can’t
control.
Finally, we’re around the windward mark and we can turn
downwind. What’s for lunch?
8.8 No More Tactics!
Tactics provide the thrill of direct confrontation with our
rivals. The interaction of attack and response challenges our
skills to react as situations evolve. We must consider not only
the boats at hand, but also the rest of the fleet and our overall
race strategy as we make split second decisions. This is hard!
Not only that, but if the wind is shifty we can lose hun-
dreds of yards in a matter is minutes. This is scary!
Maybe we’d be better off eliminating tactics from our rac-
ing, or at least minimizing their impact, but how?
No More Tactics
The trick is to rely on things you can control: boat han-
dling and boat speed. Then you can minimize the impact of
things you can’t control: the wind and other boats. Do this by
positonong the boat clear of traffic, in lanes of clear air that
allow you to sail your boat at full speed. (You can find clear air
by sailing off to the sides of the course, but that leaves you at
the mercy of the shifts. The trick is to control leverage while
maintaining clear air – no mean feat.)
The more you can rely on things you can control, the less
you will have to rely on things you can’t (Fig. 61).

8.9 Upwind Strategy and Tactics: Quiz Questions
5. You are on port tack and another port tacker is on your hip,
two lengths to weather and two and a half back. You are 400
yards from the mark, and 100 yards from the starboard tack
layline. What should you do?
6. Your boat is fast in a breeze—unfortunately today there is
very little. How might this affect your strategy?
7. How much distance do you lose by tacking?
How much do you lose if you miss a 10° shift?

1. You are on port tack in a close crossing with a starboard
boat and are unsure where the next shift is coming from. What
should you do?
2. Sailing out to the start area before the race, you are broad
reaching on starboard. You gradually got headed as you got
away from shore. What should your strategy be going upwind?
3. A bigger, faster boat just tacked on your wind 200 yards from
the fi nish line. What should you do?
4. The current is better to the right, but the wind is shifting to
the left. Which way should you go?

Skill Building: Upwind Strategy and Tactics
1. Learning to see the wind:
Sure, good sunglasses help, but there’s no magic beyond
paying attention. Here’s what to look for:
See the wind on the water – dark patches are puffs.
But which way will it shift?
You may be able to see how it is moving – but that is tough.
Your experience with the previous puffs is your best guide.
Some days they are all right shifts, some days the puffs
oscillate, some times it seems random.
Another guide is other boats. See what is going on there.
Finally, don’t let sun sparkle and cloud shadows trick you.
On a clear day the sun sparkle makes the sunny side look
windy, and on partly cloudy days cloud shadows can look
like puffs.
2. Where are we?
Describing your position on the course and in relation to
other boats is essential to tactical decision making. One
helpful description of position is the ratio of each tack re-
maining. When you are exactly in the middle of the course
you will spend equal time on each tack. As you move
toward the laylines the ratios change. A position described
as having “twice as much port as starboard” remaining
helps the whole team understand the constraint on sailing
starboard, and the desire to find a good lane and favorable
shift for sailing on port.
3. What’s going on?
As a driver it is imperative that you focus your attention on
sailing fast. At the same time, you may want to know what
is going on with other boats. Rather than look yourself,
you need to ask specific questions to help your crew
know what kind of information you are after. Over time
your crew will learn what sort of information you need,
but with new or inexperienced crew some information
training will be necessary.
Some of the questions you might ask:
How is (a nearby boat) doing compared to us: What is his
distance ahead/ behind, to weather/ leeward? How does
his speed/ pointing compare to ours?
4. Using a hand bearing compass upwind:
Often it is hard to tell if you are ahead of or behind an-
other boat, or if you are gaining or losing versus another
boat. Your hand bearing compass can tell you.
To measure your position sight perpendicular to the wind
direction. This is your LEP. Any boat on this line is
even with you. Boats above are ahead, boats below are
behind.
If you are behind another boat you can compare your
bearing to the LEP bearing. This tells you how big a
wind shift you’ll need to catch up (assuming speeds are
equal).
Your hand bearing compass is also great for calling
laylines. Practice to perfect your technique, and beware
deviation between the ships compass and your hand
bearing compass.
(NOTE: A hand bearing compass makes a great gift. Give
one to your skipper or tactician!)

5. You are on port tack and another port tacker is on your hip,
two lengths to weather and two and a half back. You are 400
yards from the mark, and 100 yards from the starboard tack
layline. What should you do?
Go into point mode and work to close the gap. Being bow
out does you no good. If you get to the layline first and tack
then the rival will tack and give you bad air. Delaying the tack
means wasted distance overstanding. Pinch up, close the gap,
and simul-tack close on the rival’s hip. Stay within two lengths
and you can attack him on the run.
6. Your boat is fast in a breeze—unfortunately today there is
very little. How might this affect your strategy?
When you can count on your boat speed then you want to
minimize the impact of strategic factors. When your speed is
suspect, more aggressive strategy is called for.
7. How much distance do you lose by tacking?
How much do you lose if you miss a 10° shift?
Tacks cost about 2 boat lengths – perhaps a little less in
smooth water, a little more in chop. A 10° lift reduces sailing
distance by about 15%. So, if you tack and sail 400 yards to
weather, you’ll save 60 yards of sailing distance – 180 feet.
You’d break even if your boat was 90 feet long, and come out
ahead with a shorter boat.
8. How does a port/starboard reversal work?
If you’re on port and duck well with good speed then
when you and your rival tack, the rival will not be able to
cross. It is the last starboard tack up the beat which matters
most – not the early ones.
1. You are on port tack in a close crossing with a starboard
boat and are unsure where the next shift is coming from. What
should you do?
Are you headed toward the middle of the course, or out to the
sides? Where is the balance of the fleet? When you are unsure of
the next shift, sail toward the mark and avoid the sides, and stay
near the bulk of your rivals to minimize leverage.
2. Sailing out to the start area before the race, you were broad
reaching on starboard. You gradually got headed as you got
away from shore. What should your strategy be going upwind?
If the condition holds then you would gradually get head-
ed going back toward shore on the opposite tack – a persistent
shift. As long as the wind strength is as good (or better) near
shore then sail to that side going upwind. If the wind strength
is even across the course then downwind the opposite side
would be favored.
3. A bigger, faster boat just tacked on your wind 200 yards from
the fi nish line. What should you do?
Cheer. If boats which owe you time are tacking on your
air a minute before the finish, then you’re in pretty good shape.
Still, you might want to clear your air, though two extra
tacks in the last minute might cost more than sailing in bad air.
Depends on how badly you’re being hurt.
4. The current is better to the right, but the wind is shifting to
the left. Which way should you go?
Tough call. A compromise up the middle might be the
worst choice. 	A knot of upwind current improves VMG about
as much as a 10° shift. How much and for how long would
you expect to have better current or the shift?

9.2 Reaching Strategy
Wind, Wind Shifts, and Current
With the two fundamentals of reaching strategy forming
our framework, we can now apply the elements of strategy:
Wind, wind shifts, and current. As with our earlier discussion
of upwind strategy, we will first look at the strategic factors to
analyze how we would sail around the course in the absence of
other boats. Then we will add other boats and consider tactical
issues.
Wind
The first deviation from our fundamental rhumb line strat-
egy revolves around changing wind conditions.
“Off in the Puffs, Up in the Lulls”
The phrase is repeated so often that it is clichéd. It is also
good strategy. In fluctuating winds, bear off below the rhumb
line in a puff to stay in the puff longer. In a lull, reach up to
Fig. 1 - Reaching Strategy starts with two fundamentals:
Sail the Rhumb Line and Sail Fast.
C HAPTER 9: R EACHING S TRATEGY AND T ACTICS
9.1 Introduction
This is not the time to have lunch. It is time to get to work.
Have half your crew eat lunch sitting on the rail going up wind.
Let the other half go hungry. Sailing downwind, we need the
entire crew’s efforts. There is much to do: Trim the spinna-
ker sheet, guy and pole, trim the main, call tactics, look back
for shifts (and the competition, hopefully), find the mark, and
more.
This chapter will cover Reaching Strategy and Tactics. We
will look first at reaching strategy, and then tactics, in a variety
of conditions. We will consider how tactics change with the
type of fleet you are racing in, and where you fit into the crowd.
Running Strategy and Tactics is an entirely different animal,
and has a chapter all its own. Rules for reaching and running
are covered in Chapter 11: Downwind Rules, Mark Roundings
and Finishing.
General Strategy
I’d like to open this section with a couple of revelations:
First, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.
(Until your boat speed approaches the speed of light this will
remain essentially true.) Second, you will not pass anyone until
you are going faster than they are. Add also the corollary: If
you can sail faster than the boats behind you, you’ll never have
to look back (Fig. 1).
Reaching strategy can be built on these two fundamentals:
• Sail the Rhumb Line.
• Sail Fast!

hold speed, and to reach the next puff sooner. We all tend to
sail down to—but not below—the rhumb line in puffs, and
above it in lulls. This is both to protect clear air, and because
it feels fast to reach up a little higher. Trouble is, it leaves you
above the rhumb line and forces you to reach off later. Avoid
this if you can. Sail below the rhumb line in puffs, so you can
preserve your fast reaching angle later in the leg (Fig. 2).
Off in puffs, up in the lulls is sound reaching strategy. It is
not always true on runs, as we will see in the next chapter.
Building Breeze / Fading Breeze
Don’t wait for a building breeze to come to you—go up
and get it. Think of a building breeze as one long lull followed
by one long puff. Go up in the lull and off in the puff to get the
best overall performance. You make big gains by aggressively
pursuing a new wind. Be bold (Fig. 3).
In a fading breeze, the same strategy applies in reverse.
The existing wind is a relative puff—sail low in it and reach up
as the breeze fades (Fig. 4). This is a difficult strategy to pursue
as tactical considerations often overwhelm it. Sailing low
invites those behind to sail over you and to steal what wind you
have. If you can hold low and keep clear air, your dividends
will be big. Reaching up in the lighter air will give you a real
boost. It will also push your apparent wind angle forward so
your air will be more difficult to steal.
Wind Shifts
Oscillating Wind Shifts
Oscillating conditions will often feel like puff and lull
conditions and should be treated that way. As the wind shifts
aft (a lift), the apparent wind will decrease. Head up to main-
tain apparent wind strength and boat speed. Similarly, as the
wind shifts forward, drive off. Use the favorable wind angle to
push down, below the rhumb line course (Fig. 5).
You should not head up one degree for each degree of
lift, nor should you drive off as many degrees as the wind
Fig. 4 - In a fading wind reach off fi rst if you
can still keep clear air. Head up later for a
faster reaching angle in the lighter wind.

reap big gains later in the leg, as you approach the mark with a
favorable wind angle.
In persistent shifts, as with oscillations, you must balance
the speed versus distance trade-offs to determine how far off
the rhumb line to sail.
Current
Current creates great strategic opportunity on reaches. The
first trick, of course, is to know what the current is going to do.
In this section we’ll take a look at strategy for current which
is consistent over the leg, and also for current which varies in
strength down the leg. For a discussion of current forecasting,
see Chapter 13: Weather later in this book.
Steady Current
When current strength and direction are consistent over
the length of the leg, the strategic goal is to correct for it by
steering a course which holds you on the rhumb line.
shifts forward. You must balance the extra speed with the extra
sailing distance to arrive at the optimum course and speed. A
change of course roughly half the angle of the shift seems a
good place to start.
Persistent Wind Shifts
In a persistent, gradual header, sail above the rhumb line
initially and let the shift push you down to the mark (Fig. 6).
In a gradual lift, the correct strategy is to sail low initially, and
then reach up to the mark as the wind shifts aft (Fig. 7).
Sailing low in anticipation of a lift is a difficult strategy to
follow. Sailing lower and slower is not a performance choice
we make easily—and the reality of tactics makes it hard to do,
as other boats may sail over us as we pursue the strategy. If
you have the discipline to work low in the early part of a reach
in a persistent lift, and if you can keep clear air, then you will

Chapter 9: Reaching Strategy and Tactics 	Page 121
If the current is pushing you to leeward you can head up
and sail a faster reaching angle. The current will then push you
down to the mark (Fig. 8).
Conversely, if the current is pushing you to windward,
you must drive off to compensate. It is in these conditions that
your efforts to correct for the current are particularly important.
If you fail to correct for current as it pushes you to windward,
you will eventually have to sail down into it at an increasingly
unfavorable reaching angle (Fig. 9).
Correcting for Current
How can you tell if the course you are steering is compen-
sating fully for the current? There are several ways (Fig. 10):
• Use a range, or transit. Sight through the mark to shore. As
long as the mark remains aligned to the same spot on the
shore, you are steering the correct angle to compensate for
the current. Note that the course you steer may vary as
your boat speed changes with changing wind conditions.
• Use a bearing, back bearing, or back range. If you cannot
establish a range ahead, try a bearing to the mark ahead, a
back bearing to the mark you just rounded, or a back range
through that mark to shore. You will be able to see if you
are being pushed off your rhumb line course.
• Use the Course Over Ground (also know as Course Made
Good) function on your GPS. If you do not have any
objects to sight, then COG can give you course informa-
tion. This information is not sound until you have been on
course for some time. The averaging and sampling time
varies from brand to brand.
The current rarely pushes you either directly to windward
or leeward. Usually there is a component of the current aligned
with the course. The current may be from your weather quarter,
or leeward bow, or whatever…
Fig. 8 - When the current
is pushing to leeward, head
up to compensate.
Fig. 9 - When it pushes to
weather, drive off. Failure to
compensate for the current can
leave you sailing a low, slow
course later in the leg. Fig 10 - Use a range or bearing, either
ahead or aft, to determine if you are
correcting suffi ciently for current.

rhumb line, fear not. As the current abates, you will not
have to sail such a high compass course to make the mark.
Furthermore, less current will shift your apparent wind
aft, allowing you to sail a higher compass course with the
same apparent wind angle (Fig. 11). For further discussion
of the current’s impact on sailing wind, see Chapter 13:
Weather.
• Current pushing to leeward and strongest at the end:
On a close reach you will want to set up by sailing a high
line early to assure a fetch. On a broader reach don’t hesi-
tate to sail a higher, faster reaching angle early on, with
the knowledge that the current will set you down to the
mark later in the leg (Fig. 12).
• Current pushing to weather and strongest at the outset:
Reach up to get across the current quickly, and you’ll
spend less time fighting it. But beware: the higher you go
The component of the current which is aligned with the
course, either on the bow or on the stern, effectively lengthens
or shortens the leg. The case where the current is at your stern
is the more interesting, as it tends to exaggerate the impact of
any distance you are pushed laterally. Boats which are high
of course will have to bear off even more to get down to the
mark, compounding their difficulties (as in fig 9 on the previ-
ous page). If they fail to compensate sufficiently, they may be
swept past the mark. This is particularly true in lighter winds,
where performance suffers most on broader reaches.
Variable Current
When current varies down the leg, it can become a key
strategic factor. We’ll look at four permutations, though count-
less other scenarios are possible.
• Current pushing to leeward and strongest at the outset:

Reaching Strategy Conclusion
Sail Fast, Sail the Rhumb Line. Sometimes strategy is just
that simple. Variables of wind, wind shifts, and current can add
some complexity, but the real excitement comes with tactics—
or lots of wind. The tactical battle for clear air and for position
at roundings or in passing lanes is where the action is.
Reaches can become parades. In similar size boats, pass-
ing can be difficult. Leaders tend to stretch out their advantage
by following the sail fast, sail straight principles, while the
rest of the fleet struggles. In mixed fleets, big boats which have
failed to round ahead roll up through the fleet, with the smaller
boats unable to stop them. It is no wonder that, to avoid reach-
ing parades, more and more races are being run on windward-
leeward courses .
Onward to Reaching Tactics, where we will battle for
clear air and work to achieve our strategic goals.
early, the lower you will have to sail later, once you are
out of the current (Fig. 13).
• Current pushing to weather and strongest at the end:
This case holds the greatest opportunities, as those who do
not anticipate the current’s set are at a distinct disadvan-
tage. As boats are pushed to weather, they are forced to
sail a lower and slower reaching angle to compensate. This
slower course increases the relative strength of the cur-
rent and compounds the error. Those who anticipate the
current’s push and set up low of the rhumb line will gain.
Of course, sailing low early in the leg is not possible if
there are rivals in hot pursuit looking to sail over you and
steal your air. That said, the lighter the wind and stronger
the current the more important it is to get low early. A
diminishing wind and strengthening current can create
devastating results (Fig. 14).

Fast, Sail Straight strategy. The rest of the fl eet must
wrestle with other boats and battle for clear air.
9.3 Reaching Tactics
Reaching tactics depend on our goals for the leg and the
conditions in which they are sailed. In boats of similar size and
speed passing other boats can be a difficult (and risky) under-
taking. You must decide if your primary goal is to pass boats,
or to simply stretch out your lead on those behind while closing
the gap on those ahead. That decision depends on your cur-
rent position in the race and the opportunities you expect down
the road. Sometimes the status quo is just fine—sometimes it
is best to wait until the next leg to pursue a more aggressive
strategy.
Much of reaching tactics revolves around keeping
clear air. Without clear air there is little chance for
success. The struggle for clear air can tear us away
from our strategy. Much of the tactical discussion
will revolve around how to keep clear air, and how to balance
that effort with our wind and current strategy for the leg. The
battle to preserve clear air tends to push the fleet above the
rhumb line on reaches. The higher course early in the leg, and
lower course later in the leg, makes the second half of the reach
slower than the first half. As the pack compresses later in the
leg, tactical opportunities increase. Careful positioning early in
the leg can bring rewards later on, and careless positioning can
lead to disaster.
Often the first few boats to round are able to hold to the
rhumb line, while the pack sails extra distance in the struggle
to preserve clear air. Consequently, the leaders tend to get away
– leaving the pack behind (Fig. 15).
Passing Other Boats
The most obvious tactical goal on a reach is to pass those
ahead of you; the obvious first step in that tactic is to sail faster
than those ahead. You’ll have a hard time passing them if you
don’t catch them first. Sail fast. (WOW, really?)
Sail fast, but don’t sail high. The easiest way to build
speed is to reach up. But it is also risky. As you sail up, the
boats ahead will reach up too. You will be adding mileage to
the leg without closing in on those ahead; and you will lose to
other boats which sail less distance.

Fig. 16 - To pass another boat, you must fi rst sail faster than
them, and then make one decisive move to get by.
Fig. 17 - Get into the Passing Lane on close reaches by sailing

Behave. Don’t sail high. Catch your rival by sailing faster
without sailing higher. Sail right up his transom, or aim at the
leeward quarter. This non-threatening approach will save you
from sailing extra distance, and it may lull the rival into com-
placency.
Look for an edge and make your move. Once you
are close astern, look for an opportunity to pounce on your
opponent’s air. You’ll need a puff, or a wave to give you a
performance edge. Or use the element of surprise when the
other crew is not paying attention. Pounce when they are pass-
ing around drinks, or removing excess clothing, or the guy is
cleated, or the main unattended (Fig. 16).
Set, Ready, Go.
You have to pounce. Ready, Set, Go takes too long. You
must be set to go at any time. Head up quickly. Trim the sheets.
Ease the guy. Hike out. Practice your pounce so everyone
knows the move. You will succeed if your crew pounces effec-
tively, and the other crew fails to respond properly.
The Passing Lane—Does it Exist?
There is a Passing Lane on close reaches. On a shy spin-
naker reach you can set up in the passing lane at the outset, by
jib reaching to a position where boats with spinnakers can’t get
up to your line. As we discussed in Chapter 2: Race Prepara-
tion earlier in this book, sailing the course in miniature before
the start will help you anticipate how tight the reaching legs
will be (Fig. 17).
Not only does the Passing Lane exist; the Get Passed
Lane exists too, and there may be times you want to get into it,
as we shall see, below.

tion a boat length or two to weather. This can save you
many boat lengths and lots of hassling later. It is much
more effective than waiting to see if anyone attacks, and
then responding. Setting up early sends the message: Don’t
even think about going by, at least not on my windward
side.
On close reaches establish a clear air lane by holding high
initially so others can’t get up to you. On a broad reach it
can also work to establish weather position early, but this
can leave you vulnerable, later in the leg, to boats working
for an inside position and mark-room.
• Pay attention.
Assign one crew to keep a lookout aft. If the trailing boat
makes a move, respond promptly. An exaggerated re-
sponse will let the other boat know you are paying atten-
tion. Make a swift, sharp turn up, then slide back down
Defending Your Position
There are several techniques you can use to protect your
position and to prevent others from passing you. The correct
technique depends on the circumstances. If a group of larger
boats is rolling up from behind, it is a waste of time and effort
to try to hold them back. When a fleet of larger boats is sailing
through you, it is time to get into the get passed lane. The get
passed lane is much the same as the passing lane—a couple of
boat lengths to weather of the fleet line. The idea is to encour-
age the larger boats to sail through you to leeward, where they
won’t sail over your air (Fig. 18).
When the attacking boats are more like you in perfor-
mance, then you must choose the appropriate defense.
• Sail fast.
Sail faster than those behind you and extend your lead!
The best defense.
• Establish a windward position (Fig. 19).

Fig. 20 - Don’t over react if your air is not threatened.
By heading up half as much as the attacker, you sail
less extra distance—and extend your lead.
Fig. 21 - Defend with vigor, or let the attacker pass. The worst
thing you can do is a halfhearted defense which takes you both

smooth return to course will give you a little breathing room.
to as close as you can to course. Holding a high line only
lengthens the leg for you.
• Don’t overreact (Fig. 20).
If you have a lead of two boat lengths or more, then your
response should be tempered. The Rule of Halves works
well here—head up half as far as the rival to keep position
between him and the mark. By sailing only half as far off
course you will sail less distance. Don’t forget: The best
defense against attack is to extend your lead.
• All or nothing (Fig. 21).
When under an immediate threat defend vigorously, or not
at all. When an opponent makes a move to pass, respond
hard and fast, with a vigorous luff and trim. As the attacker
responds to your defense, come back down and squirt out
to establish a small lead. If you are not prepared for a vig-
orous defense, you will be better off to let them pass and
get on with it. Avoid a halfhearted luffing dual, as you will
both go to the moon!
• Act First
If your attacker establishes a small overlap on your weath-
er quarter but has yet to make a full run to get over you, a
preemptive luff may catch him off guard. The panicked re-
sponse will leave him in disarray, and your smooth return
to course will give you an edge—both in position and in
psyche.

Sometimes the battle is not worth it. To let the other boat
go by either sail high and wave him through to leeward—pre-
ferred for you, but he may not take the bait, as he is likely to
get stuck there—or wave him by to weather.
When he passes to weather on a broad reach, you can
reach up and hitch a ride by drafting on his stern wave. On a
close reach force him to pass to leeward, and try to hitch by
sliding down onto his stern wave (Fig. 22). Drafting works
best when heavy boats are sailing near hull speed. You will see
them towing a big wake. Jump aboard! .
The biggest danger in letting one boat slip by is that the
next one may be on your air before you recover. Before you
know it, feels like the Fourth of July, as the whole parade
passes you by. Don’t forget to wave the flag! (Fig. 23).
Outside Reaches, Mark Roundings,
and Inside Reaches
There are two kinds of reaches—outside reaches where
the windward side is to the outside of the mark rounding, and
inside reaches where the windward side is inside. Outside
reaches lead to jibes, inside reaches lead to leeward marks. The
tactics on the two kinds of reaches differ in some important
ways (Fig. 24 a&b).
Outside Reaches
On outside reaches there are split incentives: sail up for
clear air or work down for inside position at the rounding.
Tactically a trailing boat can lure a leading boat up and then
dive inside for room as the leader squares away for the mark.
The closer you are to the mark, the more difficult it is to get the
leader to take the bait (Fig. 25).

the stern wave of a passing bigger
boat on a broad reach, or drop in

Fig. 24 a&b - On outside reaches clear air is to
the outside—you must protect both sides. On inside
reaches clear air and mark-room are on same
side—which you must double protect. Fig. 25 - On an outside reach the trailing boat can
fake an attack, and then dive inside for room.
Room Please!
As the leader in that position, it is often best to hold
course—don’t get suckered up. There are also times, as the
leader, when you may actually want to slow down to solidify
the attackers overlap on the outside, and prevent him from div-
ing inside as you square away! Obviously any slowing loses
you distance to the rest of the fleet, but not as much as you
stand to lose if the trailing boat gets mark-room and passes you
at the rounding (Fig. 26).
Mark Roundings
Tactics at the jibe depend on your position finishing the
inbound leg and your strategy for the outbound leg. Four gen-
eral routes cover most circumstances.
Most often the preferred route is to come in wide and go
out close. In wide and out close is preferred because it gives
you control and clear air as you start the next leg. To do this
you’ll need to start your turn early—two or more lengths from
Fig. 24 a 	Fig. 24 b

to slow down to hold the overlap
and prevent the dive—or ignore the
attack from the start and sail to the

room, outside boats and trailing boats will try to cut inside your
transom and roll over you. Don’t let ’em. Warn your crew and
apologize in advance, then slam the helm to force a tight turn,
spinning at the mark. Any room you can get on the approach
side will help you come out close on the exit side. With a hard
slam, you should be able to round close enough to keep trailing
boats from cutting inside (Fig. 28).
An end run can be your best tactic when a large fleet
converges on the mark in very light winds. These situations
announce themselves with a cacophony of voices, slatting sails,
and banging hulls. If you find yourself anywhere but on the
inside, consider going way outside (Fig. 29).
the mark—in order to make a smooth turn and carry speed onto
the next leg. Your goal should be to finish your turn, and be on
course to the next mark, as you come alongside the jibe mark
(Fig. 27).
The reverse—in close and out wide—happens when your
approach is low. If you are clawing to the mark on a close
reach then you may have no choice, and there is little risk. But
if your approach is low and your rounding is close and wide
while others are executing a wide and close, they will gain an
inside position, limiting your maneuverability and taking your
air.
In close, out close is hard on your crew, but sometimes
tactically necessary. When you are the inside boat, getting

Chapter 9: Reaching Strategy and Tactics 	Page 131
Inside Reaches
Inside reaches push the fleet far above the rhumb line,
since the lure of clear air and inside position at the rounding lie
on the same side. If you are the lead boat in a group, it pays to
establish an inside position immediately. As you clear the jibe
mark sail up a length or two before settling down on course. If
you don’t establish this strong position, others will be tempted
to attack. You will driven up further in the end as you work to
defend a weak position (Fig. 30).
If you find yourself in the middle of a crowd on an inside
reach, it pays to work to the inside early. Inside position and
clear air will be decisive factors, particularly as the fleet con-
verges for the rounding (Fig. 31a).
On a broad reach the tendency to sail high can push the
fleet over the mark, where it becomes necessary to jibe back. It
is a common error to sail too broad at the end of an inside reach
in an effort to avoid jibes. For those with the boat handling
skills to jibe well there is much to be gained by sailing fast
angles, and jibing into the mark (Fig. 31b).
> Fig. 31a - Break out from the pack
to get to the inside.
> Fig. 31b - On a broad reach, the
best tactic may include a strong
move to the inside and a jibe back to
the mark.
>Fig. 31c - From behind, the low
road and an end run can get you
back in contention as others battle.
< Fig. 30 - On an inside reach
establish a strong inside position to
prevent attacks.
Two other ideas deserve mention:
First, if you are part of a small group, particularly near the
lead, talk with your rivals and avoid fights. “Yo, old buddy old
pal, let’s not us get into a snit. Let’s sail fast and straight, and
get away from the teaming masses, hot on our …tails.” Once
your lead group breaks away from the crowd, you can start
infighting, but it is definitely worth it to break away first.
Second, if you are well behind, there is an opportunity for
an heroic end run. Rather than get suckered up by the crowd,
sail low—on or below the rhumb line—while the fleet sails
high. Later in the leg, as the fleet squares away to slow reach-
ing angles and they choke on each other’s bad air, you can
beam reach across the bottom of the leg and pass the crowd.
Your chances for success are enhanced by light air and adverse
current, and the risks are slight (Fig. 31c). I’m proud to men-
tion that I was crewing in the Etchells North Americans one
Autumn when we went from 29th to 8th in one leg with just
such a tactic! (Regrettably, space does not allow me to recount
how we arrived at the jibe mark 29th.)

Heavy Air Tactics
While most of the forgoing tactics apply in all wind condi-
tions, there are some special opportunities in heavy air. Light
to moderate winds result in similar sailing speeds for similar
boats, but speed differences can be pronounced in heavy air.
As the breeze comes on, shift your focus from tactics to perfor-
mance. Get clear and sail fast—the best tactic of all.
Reaching or Running?
Very broad reaches should often be treated as runs. If the
angle is broader than the proper sailing angle then strategically
the leg is not a reach, but a skewed run. Even if the leg doesn’t
initially warrant running tactics, you may need to change
modes if you find yourself well above the rhumb line (Fig. 32).
For more on Running Strategy and Tactics, look no further
than the next chapter.
Final Thoughts on Reaching Tactics
Mixed Fleet Tactics
In a mixed fleet with a broad range of handicaps, the im-
portance of tactics is diminished. You are racing the clock more
than other boats. Boats nearby are obstacles, but they may not
be rivals if they rate differently than you. Negotiate peace and
sail your boat.
If you are in a small boat near the head of the pack as you
turn down the reaches, the get passed lane may be the place for
you. Also, work for position to hitch a ride and surf a passing
boat’s stern wave.
As a big boat in the lead, you must get away from the
crowd. Any time you waste diddling with other boats will cost
you double, as every moment you spend with slower rated
boats leaves you less time to build a sufficient time margin.
When working to pass a fleet of smaller boats get up and over
the crowd, or well below them. Beware the low road. Although
you may be able to sail through one or two smaller boats with
ease the cumulative wind shadow of a gaggle of them can pre-
vent you from getting through.
If your boat performs poorly on reaches, you should work
to clog things up for the fast reaching boats. Once you round
the windward mark in good position you can hold off the fast
boats two ways: One is to establish a position to weather, as
described earlier (See Fig. 19). The other is to set up low, and
luff. This can have a cumulative effect. As you luff one boat he
will push up the next boat and so on. You can clog up the entire
fleet this way.

reaches turn into runs when
the reaching angle is broader

Fig. 1 – Runs offer trailing boats
the chance to attack. They are the
only legs where the fl eet tends to
compress rather than stretch out.
Light Air Performance
In winds from 3 to 10 knots, sailing
angles are very wide. That is, for best perfor-
mance we do not sail directly downwind, but 40°
above a dead downwind course.
Boat speed changes dramatically as the wind
fluctuates between 3 and 10 knots, but the correct sail-
ing angle changes hardly at all. In these conditions, we will

our tacking angles upwind (Fig. 2a).
In these light air conditions the off in the puffs, up in the
lulls adage we advocated for reaching does not apply. Our
sailing angle remains steady through puffs and lulls in light air
running.
Moderate Air Performance
In moderate winds sailing angle, not boat speed, is the
dynamic variable. The correct sailing angle changes dramati-
cally—by about 5° for every knot of wind speed—from 145° in
C HAPTER 10: R UNNING S TRATEGY AND T ACTICS
10.1 Introduction
More and more races are being sailed on windward-lee-
ward courses, and with good reason. Tactically, running legs
are much more interesting than reaching legs. Running legs of-
fer trailing boats a real chance to attack; runs are the only legs
where fleets tend to compress. By comparison, reaches often
turn into parades, with the fleet stretching out (Fig. 1).
Running strategy and tactics bears little resemblance to
reaching. In fact, much of running is like upwind strategy and
tactics turned on its head, with several interesting variations
and exceptions.
Performance and Strategy
Before we look at running strategy, we must first under-
stand a little about running performance. We will introduce
these performance concepts here in order to establish param-
eters for our strategy. Performance Racing Trim offers a much
more detailed discussion of these performance issues.
Downwind performance can be divided in three segments
based on wind strength: Light air, for winds from 3 to 10 knots;
moderate air for winds from 10 to 14 knots; and heavy air for
winds over 14 knots (Fig. 2). Boat performance changes from
one segment to the next, and our strategy options change as
performance changes.

Chapter 10: Running Strategy and Tactics 	Page 135
Fig. 2 – Downwind Performance can be divided into three
sectors: Light air—up to 10 knots, moderate air—10 to 14
knots, and heavy air—15 knots and above.
a – In light air, optimum performance is achieved at a high
(and consistent) reaching angle about 40° above dead
downwind.
b – In moderate air, the optimum angle changes dramatically
with the wind speed.
c – In heavy air, we can sail straight to the mark.
10 knots of wind to 165° in 14 knots of wind. Boat speeds do
increase slightly, but it is the ability to carry speed at lower and
lower angles which characterizes the moderate wind segment
of the performance spectrum (Fig. 2b).
Off in the puffs, up in the lulls is very much a part of mod-
erate air running.
Heavy Air Performance
In winds of 15 knots or greater, we can sail almost directly
downwind—or straight to the mark. The preferred sailing angle
is influenced by waves along with strategic and tactical consid-
erations (Fig. 2c).
10.2 Downwind Performance
With this understanding of downwind performance, we
can now look at downwind strategy and tactics. Obviously,
these performance parameters will dictate changes in strategy
for each segment of the performance spectrum.
Two additional comments: These wind speeds and angles
are fairly consistent for keelboats (sailing with spinnakers). For
more details, see RegattaFlow Playbook Racing Trim. Also, for wind speeds
under 3 knots, best performance is a mystery. I suggest you
keep your head down, use a smooth back swing, and follow
through toward the green. Good luck! 	180

Fig. 3a,b – If the advantage upwind was due to wind, then the
same side will be favored downwind. If the advantage upwind
was current driven, then the opposite side will be favored
downwind.
10.3 Running Strategy
As always, strategic variables are wind, wind shifts, and cur-
rent. If we look at the performance cones for each sector of
downwind sailing, we can see that in light air the cone is as
wide as the upwind cone. For moderate and heavy air sailing,
the cones are narrower. The reality is that most (too much) of
our racing is done in winds of 10 knots or less. In these condi-
tions our strategic choices are wide. The narrower performance
cones of stronger winds narrow our strategic field.
As with upwind sailing, we are looking for better wind,
and more favorable or less adverse current. We are also trying
to take advantage of wind shifts. Downwind wind shifts are a
major factor, as with upwind, but also differ from upwind in
some interesting ways, as we shall see.
Find more wind!
Favored Side
Downwind differences in wind strength have a more pro-
nounced impact on performance than they do upwind. It always
pays to find more wind. If there was a favored side upwind due
to stronger winds, then sail to the same side downwind (Fig.
3a). An advantage upwind due to current will be realized on the
opposite side downwind (Fig. 3b). Note: the right and left sides
of the course are named looking upwind. The right side upwind
and the right side downwind are the same water.
Light Air Strategy
With a wide cone, but a narrow choice of sailing angles,
light air running most closely resembles upwind strategy. Your
goals should be to find more wind, advantageous current, and
to play the wind shifts. Keep clear air by looking ahead and
behind for open lanes (Fig. 4a).
a 	b
Moderate Air
As the wind fluctuates in the moderate range, you need
room to roam up and down to maintain optimum performance
(Fig. 4b). Position yourself in front of the puffs, and with room
to work them to advantage. Since jibes (or, I should say, good
jibes) cost very little distance in moderate conditions, it pays to
jibe in search of better wind and open space.
Heavy Air
Whereas in moderate air you must work up and down
as the wind fluctuates, in heavy air there is a choice of wind
angles (Fig. 4c). You can sail a little higher and a little faster or
a little lower and a little slower, with little change in downwind
performance (VMG). The correct choice depends on strategic
issues of wind, shifts, and current; tactical concerns involving
traffic, clear air, and mark rounding position; and performance
considerations like surfing and control.

Fig. 5 – In puffy conditions look back to fi nd more wind. Look
at the water and observe other boats.
Puffs and Lulls
In puffy conditions, look back to find the puffs and posi-
tion yourself downwind of them (Fig. 5). You can see them as
darker patches moving across the water, and as they influence
the performance of boats behind you. Pay attention to close-
hauled boats as well as those on the run. Puffs are easier to read
on beating boats than running boats. The proper response to a
puff depends on which segment of the performance curve you
are in. Remember, off in the puffs is wrong in light air.
Fig. 4a,b,c – In light air we sail a wide cone – nearly as wide
as the upwind cone. In moderate winds the cone narrows as
the wind increases. In heavy air we sail nealry dead down wind
and the playing fi eld is narrow.
Puffs and lulls are often accompanied by wind shifts. For
example, puffs come with shifts from the right and lulls come
with shifts from the left. It is critical to get in phase with the
shifts as well as playing the puffs. We’ll cover wind shifts in
more detail below.
In a dying breeze, work for a position which will keep you
in clear air and clear of crowds. Pay careful attention to perfor-
mance, and be sure to sail fast angles as the wind gets light. In
a building breeze, focus on getting to the new wind first; then
match your performance to the conditions. Great boat speed is
always a powerful tactic.

Fig. 6 – In oscillating shifts jibe on
the lifts and sail the headed tack— the
inverse of upwind strategy, where we tack
on the headers to sail lifted.
Wind Shifts
Wind shifts don’t stop when you round
the windward mark. You need to make the most
of wind shifts downwind, just as you do upwind.
The trouble is that downwind shifts are trickier than
upwind shifts, for a number of reasons. The upside
is that if you can figure them out, it will give you a
big strategic advantage.
The Main Idea
Wind shift strategy downwind is like
upwind shift strategy stood on its head.
Instead of sailing the lifted tack, as you do
upwind, the objective is to sail on the headed
tack—allowing you to sail more of a reach,
rather than a run, to the leeward mark. In
oscillating winds this means jibing on the lifts downwind, the
reverse of tacking on the headers upwind. In persistent shifts
this means sailing away from the shift in order to jibe onto the
headed tack later in the leg—the inverse of sailing into the shift
and tacking onto the lifted tack upwind.
So far so good, but there is more. For starters let’s take a
closer look at downwind strategy in oscillating and persistent
shift conditions.
Oscillating Shifts
Oscillating winds are winds which are shifting back and
forth, oscillating like a pendulum. In oscillating conditions
your goal is to sail the headed tack downwind. Once you are
on the headed tack, watch for a lift. When you are lifted, jibe
to sail headed on the new tack. When you are lifted, jibe again
(Fig. 6).
The first step is to get in phase as you round from the
windward leg. The best way to do this is to note the headed
tack as you approach the windward mark, and then get onto
this headed tack at the first opportunity downwind (Fig 7).
Even when you start the leg in phase with the shifts, it is
easy to get out of phase or lose track—wind shifts are difficult
to detect when you are sailing downwind. If all else fails, sail
the jibe which carries you closest to the mark.
Later we’ll discuss techniques for detecting shifts—it can
be tricky.
Ch10 fig 1
Fig. 7 – To get in phase, note the lifted tack upwind.
Assume the opposite tack as you start down the run.

Chapter 10: Running Strategy and Tactics 	Page 139
Persistent Shifts
A persistent shift is a gradual shift in one direction, either
veering consistently clockwise, or backing counterclockwise.
In persistent shifts sail away from the shift downwind rather
than sailing into the shift as you do upwind. By sailing away
from the shift you can jibe to a closer reaching angle. Sailing
toward the shift would leave you in a position more upwind of
the mark, requiring a broader sailing angle to the mark (Fig. 8).
>>ALERT ALERT<< Major Exception: This persistent
shift strategy fails in a building and shifting wind. In that case
it is best to sail to the new wind—wind strength is a more im-
portant factor than wind shifts (Fig 9).
Fig. 8 – In a persistent
shift, sail away from the
shift to get a favorable
reaching angle.
Fig. 9 – In a building
and shifting wind, ignore
the shift strategy above.
Sail toward the shift
— Get More Wind!
Fewer Shifts, Harder to Find
There are a couple of things which make wind shifts more
difficult downwind than upwind. One is that they are more dif-
ficult to detect. There are several techniques for detecting the
shifts, which we discuss more below – I promise.
The second difficulty is that there are fewer shifts down-
wind than upwind.
Whoa! Fewer wind shifts downwind than upwind! We sail
upwind, and turn and sail the other way, and the windshifts turn
off? How can that be? Turn the page, and find out...

Page 140 	RegattaFlow Playbook. Racing Tactics
Fewer Shifts Downwind!
Imagine, first of all, a Race Committee at anchor
in a 10 knot wind. As they set a course, they record
the wind speed and wind direction and find oscillating
wind shifts every six minutes. With a wind speed of
ten knots, a six-minute interval places the shifts one
mile apart.
You (a very astute tactician) detect a shift three
minutes before the start. How soon after the start will you
hit the first shift? Three minutes, right? Wrong!
You would expect the next shift at the start area three
minutes after the start. You (with any luck) will no longer
be in the start area – you will be racing upwind, and meet
the shift part way. Sailing at about six knots of boat speed*
your upwind speed (Velocity Made Good, VMG) is about
four knots. You are sailing toward the wind shifts and the
closing speed is fourteen knots (10 knots of wind speed plus
4 knots VMG). The frequency of shifts for boats racing up-
wind increases to a shift every 4 minutes, 18 seconds.
As you turn downwind, you sail away from the shifts.
Instead of meeting them half way as you were upwind, you
are now running away from the shifts. With a VMG down-
wind of about four knots, the closing speed of the shifts is
reduced to six knots. (10 knots of wind speed less 4 knots
VMG.) Downwind, you experience shifts once every 10 min-
utes, or less than half the frequency of the shifts experienced
upwind (Fig. 10a, c).
The ratio of wind shifts experienced upwind and down-
wind changes with the wind speed and boat performance – but
not very much. In lighter air or with faster boats the differ-
ences are exaggerated to the point where the fleet experiences

Fig. 10a – In a 10-knot wind with shifts spaced 1 mile apart,
the Race Committee, at anchor, experiences a shift every 6
minutes. Boats racing upwind experience shifts every 4 min 17
sec, while boats sailing downwind only experience a shift once
every 10 minutes! You will experience more than twice as many
shifts upwind as downwind.

oscillating shifts upwind and one persistent shift on the
downwind leg.

boat. Yours may vary.

Chapter 10: Running Strategy and Tactics 	Page 141
Oscillating vs. Persistent
There will be times when you will have oscillating shifts
upwind and persistent shifts downwind. By persistent shifts, we
mean that there is only one shift for the duration of the leg—
consequently your strategy is persistent shift strategy. This can
occur any time the downwind shift frequency is more than half
the sailing time of the leg, which means upwind you would
experience three or four shifts (Fig. 10b).
The main point remains to sail away from the shift, and
then jibe to sail headed, regardless of the frequency of shifts.
Just be aware that there may not be very many shifts to hunt.
One further insight: Don’t be deceived by the change to persis-
tent shifts downwind. When you turn upwind, the oscillations
will return.
Find the Shifts
As we said above, one of the tricks to downwind strategy
is detecting wind shifts. One way to take the mystery out of
downwind shifts is properly calibrated true wind instruments.
With integrated instruments, the shifts are much easier to find.
It is almost like cheating. Careful calibration is a must. Other-
wise it is “garbage in, garbage out.”
Here’s how to find the shift if you are sailing without inte-
grated instruments. (And of course, even if you have high-tech
instruments, you should use them as adjuncts to methods we’ll
describe, not in lieu of them.) First, after rounding the wind-
ward mark settle onto the correct tack—the headed tack you
noted at the end of the beat, and the proper performance angle
and speed—as described in Downwind Performance above,
and in RegattaFlow Playbook. Racing Trim. Once you settle, note your wind
angle, boat speed, and compass course. To find the shifts, you
must look for changes in this base line performance.
only one-third as many shifts downwind as upwind. In heavier
winds the ratio remains about two-to-one.
Only when the wind is very strong does the frequency of
shifts upwind and downwind converge significantly. By then
you can stop looking for shifts downwind—just hang on, hoot
and holler.
There are a couple of interesting consequences to the
reduced frequency of wind shifts downwind. One is the chal-
lenge of finding these infrequent shifts (which we will get to,
momentarily, I promise). The second consequence is that oscil-
lating shifts upwind may become persistent shifts downwind, at
least for the duration of the leg.

boat in the race show the apparent compression and elongation
of the wind shift frequency as the boat races upwind and down.

If the apparent wind speed drops, you are either in a lift
or a lull (or a wind shadow or you have changed course). In a
lull the apparent wind angle will initially shift forward. Your
boat speed will drop. If you head up to try to accelerate you
will have to re-trim to the new wind. (This is not the correct
response to a lull in light air, but is correct in moderate winds.)
In a lift, the apparent wind will shift aft. You can hold
your course and bring the pole back—your speed will drop, or
head up to keep the original boat speed and apparent wind—at
a higher compass course. The correct response is neither of
those—the correct response is a jibe!
The spinnaker trimmer and helmsman must pay close at-
tention to find the lifts. It is more difficult than detecting head-
ers upwind, which you can read in the jib and compass, and

apparent wind angle and apparent wind speed are much more
volatile. Careful study is needed to tell if a change in appar-
ent wind is due to a change in the true wind speed, true wind
direction, or in sailing angle. The spinnaker trimmer must feel
changes in the tug on the sheet and in spinnaker trim, and the
helmsman must feel the helm and note the course, speed, and
pole angle in order to differentiate lulls from lifts (Fig. 11).
Another important tool in finding the shifts is observ-
ing other boats. When you feel a change on your boat, see if
it shows on other boats. It is particularly valuable to compare
your performance to the performance of boats on the opposite
jibe. If performance on all the nearby boats is suffering, then
you are in a lull. If boats on the opposite jibe seem to be sail-
ing lower angles while carrying speed, that would suggest you
have been lifted and ought to jibe. Also, watch performance of
boats which are sailing upwind; they are still doing shift the

Fig. 13 – The impact of wind shifts downwind is huge. With a
six-knot boat speed, and a 10° shift from a course 40° above
dead downwind, the checkered boat will sail 90 seconds per
mile faster than the white boat which ignores the shifts, and 4
minutes faster than the grey boat which gets it all wrong.
Note: If boat speeds are slower, times will be greater!
easy way. If the close hauled boats in your wind neighborhood
are on one tack, then try the opposite tack. In addition, be
cognizant of the shift pattern you noted upwind—are the puffs
all starboard tack lifts?
Finally, don’t forget to look at the water. You can see puffs
on the water surface. If your course changes with no discern-
ible change in true wind speed, you are in a shift (Fig 12).
The Impact of Shifts
In winds up to 10 knots, the impact of shifts downwind
is enormous, comparable to the impact of shifts upwind. In a
10° shift, the headed boat will gain 22% versus a boat which is
sailing lifted. A boat working the shifts will gain 10% versus a
boat which ignores the shifts. That adds up to 90 seconds per
mile for boat speeds of 6 knots (Fig. 13). At slower speeds, in
lighter winds, the time difference is even greater!
In moderate winds, the impact is somewhat diminished,
though still huge. In heavy air, there is little room to play the
shifts since the fastest course is straight to the mark.
For a boat sailing at six knots, the numbers work out like
this on a per mile basis:
Boat 	Course 	< to Rh 	VMG 	1 mile time
Black 	Lifted 10° 	50° 	3.858 	15 min 33 sec
White 	No Shifts 	40° 	4.596 	13 min 3 sec

Attack Downwind
More and more race committees are running windward
leeward courses instead of conventional triangles. Part of the
reason is the additional tactical challenge of running legs. To
succeed, you need to use the same aggressive approach to wind
shifts downwind that you use upwind. You stand to gain or lose
hundreds of yards in the shifts downwind, just as upwind.
Because it is harder to do downwind, the differences
across the fleet can be even greater than on a beat. Don’t miss
the opportunity. Get in phase by paying attention to conditions
at the end of the windward leg, search for the rare and elusive
shifts downwind, and jibe on the lifts!

Fig. 14 – When the current is pushing
across the course, it shifts the laylines. Use
a COG bearing to call the layline.
Fig. 16 – When the current is behind
you, you can jibe early and let the
current sweep you down to the mark.
Fig. 15 – When the current is against you,
it is easy to jibe too early and miss the
layline. If necessary, jibe again rather than
force a low angle against the current.
Current
Favored Side
Strong current can become the singular strategic concern.
If there was a favored side to the course on the beat, and the
advantage was current driven, then sail the opposite side on the
run. (See fig. 3b., earlier)
Uniform Current
If the current is uniform over the length of the leg, then it
will skew the course and shorten or lengthen the sailing time
on the leg. When the current is running across the course de-
termine the Course Over the Ground—COG (or Course Made
Good—CMG) by sailing past a buoy at the proper wind angle
and taking a back bearing. Use this information to determine
laylines to the leeward mark. Depending on whether you ap-
proach the mark from the up current or down current side, it is
easy to over- or under- stand the mark (Fig. 14).
When the current is against you, the biggest impact is on
the approach to the leeward mark. Boats will jibe onto what
appears to be a proper angle, only to have the current push
them up and force them to sail a lower, and slower angle in
order to avoid more jibes. As they slow down, the impact of
the current is greater, and the problem is compounded. Avoid
this error by determining your COG and then use that bearing
to call your layline (Fig. 15). Furthermore, if you find you have
not compensated sufficiently jibe again. (Your crew can handle
it—you’ve practiced.)
Current from astern shortens the leg. The danger here is
overstanding the leeward mark. You need to establish your
COG to call the layline. When in doubt, jibe early and let the
current carry you down. You can get away with cheating the

Chapter 10: Running Strategy and Tactics 	Page 145
layline here, unlike when you are against the current. Also,
warn your crew. The mark will sneak up on you before you
expect it. Get the jib ready early (Fig. 16).
Non-Uniform Current
When the current is crossing the course and it is stronger
in the beginning or end of the leg, your current strategy is to
minimize the distance sailed through the water. As you might
have guessed, you should seek a position where you can let the
current help you when it is strongest.
If the current will be stronger later in the leg, then posi-
tion yourself up current while the current is weak and let the
current sweep you down to the mark. In doing this you will get
the added benefit of a sailing wind header during the current
portion of the leg. If you sail to the down current side initially,
then you will end up fighting the current later on. Your troubles
would be compounded by a less favorable wind angle as well
(Fig. 17).
If the current is stronger early, don’t fight it. Let it sweep
you down and correct for it later. Sail the jibe which is headed
by the current until you run out of current, and sail the other
jibe later (Fig. 18).
Fig. 18 – When the current is stronger early in the leg don’t
fi ght it. Sail the jibe which is headed by the current to get out of
it most quickly.
Fig. 17 – If you know the current will be stronger later in
the leg, set up on the up current side of the course while the
current is weak so you will have the current on your stern when
it is strongest..

10.4 Running Tactics
With our strategic game plan set based on expected wind,
wind shifts, and current; we will use tactics to put our plan into
place.
Beginning of the Leg
As you round, get onto the favored jibe (either the headed
jibe in shifting winds or the jibe which will take you to the
favored side of the course) as quickly as possible. A decisive
tactical move can allow you to break away at the rounding
while others are still sorting out their options (Fig. 19).
If the right is favored, a jibe set is the quickest way to hit
that side. Just beware that on a port broad reach you must stay
clear of all boats sailing upwind. [Author’s note: As you master
the skills presented in this book, you no doubt will find that
you often round in front of your fleet. Consequently, you will
frequently be sailing back through them as you start down the
run. Such are the burdens of leadership.]
In a big fleet, use a bear-away set to a fast reaching angle
to break out of the wind shadow at the top of the leg. Once
clear of the crowd, jibe or carry on, as strategy dictates.
Attack those Ahead
Running legs give trailing boats the chance to attack
leaders. Early in the leg, you get in the attack position. Later
in the leg, you attack. Chase the boat(s) you want to attack as
they sail to the sides of the course, then attack by jibing inside
as they come back. If you try to get on their air as they sail to
the outside, you leave them an escape route. It is better to be
patient, and attack while sailing toward the middle (Fig. 20a).

-- 153 of 191 --

Chapter 10: Running Strategy and Tactics 	Page 147
To make your attack work, you should jibe early and sail
down on your rival, cutting off the escape route. Sail down un-
til the rival is aligned with your windex. If you are within three
or four mast heights, you will have an impact. Watch to see his
spinnaker curl as he enters your shadow … and look back to be
sure no one is doing the same to you (Fig. 20b).
The closer you get, the greater your effect. If the leader
jibes back out, you do the same. Get into attack position and
be ready to strike again when he jibes in. Your frequent attacks
will challenge each boats jibing skills. Practice those jibes.
Keeping Clear Air
As a lead boat, the challenge is it to keep clear air while
implementing your strategy. Work the shifts or favored side,
and look for lanes which will allow you to sail the middle in
clear air. If you are threatened by a pack of trailing boats chas-
ing you to the outside of the leg you may need to jibe early and
reach up to break across their wind shadow.
Remember, jibes (which is to say, good jibes) cost very
little. Be a moving target. Don’t let attackers set up on you. As
you work toward the favored side, a quick jibe and jibe back
can throw off an attacker; or give you a position for a later jibe
which will allow you to break through to the inside. If you find
your air threatened, reach up to break through or jibe away im-
mediately. Don’t delay (Fig. 21).
Sailing down the middle of the leg can be difficult in the
middle or forward sections of a large fleet. Look for lanes of
clear air and try to find a position inside a pack of potential
attackers. Anticipate their jibes to keep out of their shadows
(Fig.22).
< Fig. 21 – To defend your air either
reach up to break through the wind
shadow or jibe away.
> Fig. 22 – To keep clear air,
look back and position yourself
in a lane of clear air. As boats
jibe, their wind shadows’ shift.
Anticipating the position of a
clear lane is tricky.

Fig. 23 – Sailing into the corners presents
the same hazards downwind as upwind. Once
you are in the corner, you lose your strategic
fl exibility and you are subject to attack with
no way to escape.
Fig. 24 – If the leg is skewed so
one tack is longer than the other,
try to sail the long tack fi rst. The
short tack will lead you quickly to a
corner, and the hazards found there.
Of course, as difficult as it may be to sail the middle, it
is recommended. Sail to the corners only when there is a clear
and definite strategic advantage. As with upwind sailing, it is
usually best to…
… Avoid the Corners
As upwind, the corner leaves us strategically spent, un-
able to take advantage of changing winds, vulnerable to attack,
and devoid of tactical options (Fig. 23).
The corners are easy to reach if the run is skewed—so that
you will spend substantially more time on one tack than the
other. It is generally best to sail the long tack first—just as we
do upwind. The danger in sailing the short tack first is that we
quickly may find ourselves in the corner (Fig. 24).
Of course, if the run is so heavily skewed that no jibe will
be required, then it is no longer a run but a reach, and reaching
tactics apply.
End of Leg Positioning
As the fleet converges at a leeward mark rounding, your
weapons are: speed, positioning, and right of way. To achieve
speed, work through a proper reaching angle into the mark.
Avoid the trap of forcing the boat too low to avoid jibes late
in leg. With proper crew work, extra jibes at the end of the leg
will not mess up your spinnaker take down and rounding. (See
Performance Racing Trim for Boat Handling details!)

entire pack at the rounding, you may get room from a bunch of
them; and if not then you round behind, just as you would have
from the outside (Fig. 26).
You Can Do It, If You Can
Have I mentioned the role of good boat handling in tacti-
cal success? Tactical ideas are only as good as the boat han-
dling and boat speed they accompany. There is a special thrill
to the teamwork of attacking a rival, and watching their boat-
handling unravel under your team’s attacks.
Inside position and right of way often go hand in hand.
A starboard tack approach into the mark gives you both. The
rounding, from a starboard broad reach to port tack close
hauled, is not as difficult as you might imagine, though it might
be worth practicing once or twice before you try it in competi-
tion. Incidentally, it is surprising how often inside position at
the end of the leg can be traced back to a jibe set or early posi-
tioning to that side early in the leg (Fig. 25).
If you find yourself on the outside of a pack in the later
stages of a run, make a bold move to the inside. There is little
at risk and much to be gained. Even if you can’t pick off the

Fig. 27 – When racing under jib and
main; wing the jib, heel to weather,
and sail slightly by the lee for best
speed.
Since the performance cone is
narrow, you can use your wind
shadow to attack boats ahead.
10.5 Jib and Main Racing
If you are racing non-spinnaker, with just jib
and main then tactics change in several ways.
Narrow Cone
The performance guidelines described at the
beginning of this chapter do not apply. For best down-
wind performance under jib and main; sail wing and
wing, directly at the mark, and slightly by the lee, with wind-
ward heel. (See RegattaFlow Playbook. Racing Trim for more trim details.)
Strategy
Sometimes the course to the mark is on the cusp between
carrying wing and wing and sailing a jib reach. If you will have
to sail part of the leg running wing and wing, and part broad
reaching with the jib to leeward, then you can use standard
strategic criteria to decide when to reach and when to run.
Wind strategy calls for running off in puffs, and reaching up
in lulls. Current positioning is more critical than with spinna-
kers as boats are relatively slower. In shifts, try a direct course,
altering trim as winds oscillate. You will experience more shifts
than under spinnaker, as you will not be running away from
them as fast, but you will still experience fewer shifts down-
wind than upwind.
A run which is sailed entirely on starboard resembles an
outside reach, while a port tack run resembles an inside reach,
as described in the previous chapter.
Tactics
Since the performance cone is narrow, defending boats
have a difficult time escaping an attack. As an attacker, put
your wind shadow on the bow of the lead boat and reel them in.
On a skewed leg you can attack leaders by sailing over
their air on a broach reach before settling on their air, wing
and wing. If you are in the lead, do most of your reaching first,
across the windward edge of the cone. If you run first, you may
find yourself reaching in bad air later on. Try to save some
of your reaching for the final segment of the leg, as the extra
speed and maneuverability gives you an advantage as boats
converge at the mark (Fig. 27).
10.6 Conclusion
Downwind legs present all the strategic and tactical chal-
lenge of upwind sailing with the added challenge of spinnaker
handling and trim. While most racers are attuned to upwind
strategy and tactics, many mistakenly treat runs like reaches—
creating real opportunity for those who appreciate the differ-
ence.
Sail fast, hit the shifts if you can find them, and keep clear
air. Our next topics are downwind mark roundings, finishes and
rules.

10.7 Quiz Questions and Skill Building
A hand bearing compass is a great tool for running tactics,
just as it is upwind. Use your “puck” to sight across an LEP to
determine position, judge port/starboard crossings, and to call
laylines. Also, use the puck to measure performance against
other boats. As bearings change, you are gaining or losing. In
this way you can determine if you are sailing the correct angle
or too high/fast or too low/slow.
One area you can work on is communication, in describing
another boats performance—particularly a trailing boat.
Discuss the terms you will use. Performance should be
described in relation to your boat in a consistent format; i.e.
distance back, distance high or low, sailing angle and speed.
E.g. “Dennis is 1 length back, on our line, sailing slightly
higher and faster.”
Your tactician will need to stay a step ahead, anticipating
initial conditions on the reach—strategically and tactically—
during the fi nal segment of the beat. At times he may not be
able to know what will happen—will you round ahead or
behind some of your rivals? In that event, he may still be able
to tell you on the approach that upon rounding you will either:
Sail high with the jib on a course of xx° or set immediately on
a course of yy°—I’ll call it as soon as I can by saying either
“jib reach at xx°” or “spinnaker set to yy°.”

-- 158 of 191 --

1. How can you anticipate the wind angle on an upcoming
reach?
There are a number of ways to anticipated the wind angle.
The first is to sail the course in miniature before the start
(as described in Chapter 2 - Race Preparation). You
can use that info as a baseline, and factor in any changes
to conditions since that time.
You can also compare the compass course for the leg to
the wind direction. As you get to know your boat, you
should catalog the highest effective true and apparent
wind angles for carrying a spinnaker in different wind
speeds.
2. How does the expected wind angle of the next leg affect your
approach angle to a jibe mark?
If the next leg will be a close reach, then be sure to come
in high and jibe early so you can exit the jibe mark with
a high, inside line.
If the next leg will be broad, then your approach angle is
not so critical. As long as you don’t have other boats
hot on your heels, you can sail wide coming out of the
mark onto a broad reach.
3. You approach the windward mark on a port lift in an
oscillating breeze. How does this affect your initial sailing
angle on the reach (on starboard tack)? How about on a run?
Sailing a reach in oscillating winds, we treat the shifts
similar to a puff / lull cycle, sailing off in the headers,
and up in lifts. With starboard headed, we’d want to sail
low initially on the reach, as long as we could do so and
Quiz Answers
still maintain clear air.
On a run, we’d do a bear away set to starboard tack and
sail headed until we detect a lift.
4. When might you not try to pass a boat ahead of you?
Approaching a mark there are times when it is best to
work for an inside overlap rather than try to pass on the
outside.
5. Would you ever want to slow down on a reach?
There are a number of times you might want to slow down
as you approach a mark. As an inside boat, sometimes
you want to slow down to keep an outside boat over-
lapped outside. If the outside boat falls astern, they
might try to dive inside.
Also, as a trailing boat, you can get an inside overlap too
early, sail up into bad air, and then lose the overlap as
you slow down.
As a lead boat, you might want to slow to let an inside
boat get an overlap inside, and then give them bad air,
so you can accelerate and break the overlap.
6. What sort of wind conditions make it possible to catch a tow
from another boat? What types of boats provide the best tows?
In full-power hull speed conditions you can hitch a ride
on the stern wave of boats up to about 20% faster than
you. Heavier boats throw bigger wakes, and are easiest
to hitch on.

11.1 Introduction
In this chapter we will cover downwind rules, mark
rounding tactics and rules, and finishing tactics and rules.
Right of way can change quickly. A clear understanding of the
rules is needed if you are to receive your due and fulfill your
obligations. Furthermore, many offwind and rounding tactics
involve the rules, so an understanding of the rules is essential
to tactics.
The rules for upwind sailing and upwind mark roundings
are covered in Chapter 8 – Upwind Tactics.
11.2 Downwind Rules
The same-tack rules predominate on reaches. Rules 11
and 12 cover windward/ leeward and overtaking situations.
Rule 15 covers acquiring right of way, Rule 16 addresses alter-
ing course, and Rule 17 covers proper course issues. As we
move from reaches to runs, we must add consideration of op-
posite tacks (Rule 10).
Windward/ Leeward
The leeward boat always has the right of way. Stop Re-
peat: The leeward boat always has the right of way; the wind-
ward boat shall keep clear.
The interaction of windward and leeward boats depends
on how the overlap was established. When a boat is passing to
windward, a leeward boat may change course as she pleases,
constrained only by Rule 16.1, which requires that she give the
other boat room to keep clear. The windward boat must use the
room provided and promptly keep clear (Fig. 1a).
C HAPTER 11: D OWNWIND R ULES , MARK R OUNDINGS , AND FINISHING
Fig. 1a – When a boat is passing to windward, a leeward boat
may change course provided she gives the windward boat
room to keep clear.
L
W
If the overtaking boat establishes an overlap to leeward
within two boat lengths, then he shall not sail above her proper
course (Rule 17) (Fig. 1b).
The definition of keep clear requires that the windward boat
establish his overlap in such a way that the leeward boat could
change course without immediately making contact with the wind-
ward boat. In other words, when the windward boat establishes
his overlap, he must allow himself room to keep clear.
Other Downwind Rules
Two other downwind situations deserve mention. First,
a boat clear astern must keep clear (Rule 12). Second, a
starboard-tack boat has right of way over a port-tack boat

11.3 Mark Rounding Rules and Tactics
Mark roundings on reaches and runs have a set of rules
and tactics which are distinct from windward mark roundings.
Rounding Alone
In wide, out close.
When rounding an offwind mark alone, complete the turn
and be on course for the next leg as you pass the mark. The
wide turning radius necessary to hold speed through the round-
ing requires that you start wide of the mark in order to finish
close. Practice wide-and-close roundings wherever you are,
under sail or power, to improve your feel for your boat’s han-
dling characteristics. You’ll find you need a two boat length
radius to carry speed well through a turn (Fig. 3).
Fig. 3 – When rounding alone, use a smooth turn
to carry speed. Come in wide and go out close for
best position, as the checkered boat is doing.
Fig. 2 – The Checkered boat has right
of way over the trailing boat as a boat
clear ahead, and over the lead boat by
starboard/port.
L
W
Fig. 1b – A leeward boat which
establishes an overlap from astern shall
not sail above her proper course.
(Rule 10). Just as upwind, you are better off to take a starboard
boat’s stern than to risk a foul—or be forced into a sudden jibe.
Note also that the port starboard rule applies even when com-
ing from behind on a run. The clear astern rule applies only to
boats on the same tack (Fig. 2).

-- 162 of 191 --

Page 156 	RegattaFlow Playbook. Racing Tactics
The wide-and-close rounding carries speed through the
turn and places you to windward with clear air and freedom
to maneuver. Proper roundings save boat lengths. A proper
rounding at a leeward mark lets your carry reaching speed up
to a close-hauled course. A proper rounding at a jibe mark
protects your air if the next leg is broad, and gives a little extra
height when struggling on a close reach.
Although this section is short, its importance cannot be
overstated. Usually you round alone. Proper roundings can
save half a minute or more on a six-legged course.
Rounding through Gates
When the leeward mark is set as a gate, you must choose
which side to round. Much like a starting line, the choice
depends on three factors: which mark is to the favored side,
which end is furthest upwind, and which mark is least crowded.
As these factors are often in conflict, the decision can be diffi-
cult. If the gate is set out of square to the wind by 10°, then the
advantage at the upwind end equals half the distance between
the marks. Equally difficult are the boat handling gyrations
needed to accommodate a last minute change of tactics (Fig. 4).
Once an end has been selected, then the rules and tactics
are like those at any single mark. Just beware the rules as you
crisscross with a competitor who has selected the other end!
Rounding with Company
When rounding with company, Rule 18: Passing Marks
and Obstructions governs. This rule is the source of many pro-
tests and appeals, most of which involve the elusive three boat
length zone.
Fig. 4 – When rounding through gates, pick the favored side
– then change your mind at the last instant to challenge your
crew! The rules are the same as those at leeward marks.
Fig. 5 – As the outside boat reaches the three length zone, any
boat overlapped inside is entitled to room at the mark. The grey
boat does not get room, and the white and black boats are entitled
to room regardless of what may happen later. (See Fig. 6.)

-- 163 of 191 --

Chapter 11: Downwind Rules, Mark Roundings, and Finishing 	Page 157
Fig. 6 – Moments later the grey boat has achieved
an overlap, and the black and white boats have
lost theirs. The mark-room rights are unchanged:
No room for grey, room for black and white.
Fig. 7a – Since the inside boat does
not have an overlap earlier, he must
show that he achieved an overlap on
time.
Fig. 7b – Here the inside boat has an
overlap, and the outside boat claims to
have broken it. So the burden falls to the
outside boat to show that it was broken.
The Three Hull Length Zone
When approaching a mark with company, the question is
whether the boats were overlapped before reaching the zone
– which is three hull lengths from the mark. Any boat over-
lapped to the inside is entitled to room (Fig. 5).
Late Breaks & Overlaps
If an inside boat establishes an overlap after the outside
boat reaches the three length zone, she is not entitled to room.
The overlap must exist before the lead boat hits the zone.
Similarly, if an inside boat has an overlap at the zone, she is
entitled to room even if the overlap is broken a moment later
(Rule 18.2b). To repeat: Room requirements are established
when the lead boat reaches the zone. Anything which happens
after that time is of no consequence (Fig. 6).
Approaching the Zone
The situation prior to reaching the zone is determinative
if there is a dispute (Rule 18.2d). A skipper claiming to have
established or broken an overlap just before reaching the zone
must established his claim beyond reasonable doubt if protest-
ed (Fig. 7a&b).
Therefore, though no hail is required, it is good practice
as you approach the zone to establish the situation—overlap or
no. Don’t wait until you’re in the zone to open communica-
tions.

Fig. 8 – The inside boat asks the outside boat if there is an
overlap. The outside boat hails, “3 lengths, no overlap, no
room.” Accepting this, the inside boat turns to go outside,
and hits. Well, what do you know – there must have been
an overlap.
Fig. 9a – An inside windward boat
is only entitled to room to sail to
the mark, not a tactical wide-and-
close rounding.
Fig. 9b – The outside boat
should make a tactical turn to
end up behind, not outside, the
inside boat.
So go ahead, put the burden of sportsmanship on him.
You can trust those you race against to be fair and honest.
Of course, if sportsmanship fails, you can always fall back
on the rule of law. When the outside boat hails…
Three boat lengths, no overlap, no room!
…you turn smartly to the outside to stay clear. If you hit,
then you have proof through performance that there was an
overlap. If it comes to a protest you will need to establish that
both boats were traveling at the same speed on parallel courses,
and that you made an immediate turn when hailed (Fig. 8).
And if you don’t hit—well, then I guess you didn’t have
an overlap after all. But chances are your rival has been so
preoccupied with the mark-room call that his rounding will be
a mess, and you will pass him in short order regardless.
A Gentleman’s Sport
Given the occasional differences of opinion about the ex-
act position of the three boat length zone, prior discussion can
be critical. As an inside boat you should ask the outside boat to
call the overlap and the three boat length zone. Put the burden
on the outside boat. Is it too much to expect an honest appraisal
from our rival? “Do let us know if we’ve got an overlap at the
zone, won’t you?”
It certainly is easier for the lead boat to call the situation.
From the helm, he can more easily judge an overlap at his stern
and your bow than you can from your helm. And he is also in
a better position to call when his bow reaches the three boat
length zone. You, after all, may still be nearly five lengths
from the mark when his bow reaches the zone.

Chapter 11: Downwind Rules, Mark Roundings, and Finishing 	Page 159
As an outside boat, be sure to let the inside boat know if
you have an overlap. By restricting the inside boat to a safe
rounding, you will be able to get a better position around the
mark; on the inside boat’s hip (Fig. 11). If the inside boat
makes a tactical rounding, you will likely end up directly astern
of the inside boat, in bad air, as in Fig. 10.
“Able to Give”
The outside boat must give room if she is able to give
room. A boat establishing a late inside overlap (just prior to 2
boat lengths) may not be entitled to room. If the outside boat
cannot give the room, due to a crowd of boats outside her, for
example, the inside boat is not entitled to it (Fig. 12).
If the inside boat has a long-established overlap, then
she is entitled to room, and the outside boat must plan in
anticipation of giving room. But if the inside boat gets an
overlap at the last moment, it may not be possible to get room
(Rule 18.2e).
How Much Room?
An inside boat is entitled to room to make a safe (concen-
tric) rounding. An inside or clear ahead Right of Way boat can
make a tactical (wide-and-close) rounding (Fig. 9a). As a first
approximation, one boat length of room is not too much; and in
some conditions more room is justified. On the other hand, an
inside boat has taken too much room if another boat manages
to sneak inside. Protest if this happens, but as an outside boat
never let the inside boat touch you. Stay clear and protest, and
you will be safe. Once there is contact, you may be in trouble.
The existence of an overlap is important even if the inside
boat is leading the outside boat. If the inside boat is clear
ahead, she may make a tactical wide-and-close rounding. If the
outside boat has an overlap the inside boat is restricted to a safe
rounding (Fig. 10).
Fig. 11 – If the outside boat has an overlap,
the inside boat is entitled to room to sail to the
mark, not a tactical wide-and-close rounding.
The outside boat will end up in better position.
Fig. 12 – An outside boat must give an
inside boat room if she can. Here the white
boat arrives too late for space to be made.
Fig. 10 – If the outside boat is clear
astern, the inside boat had right of way
and can make a tactical rounding.

Fig. 13 – Beware: No Brakes! As the inside boat makes a sharp
turn at the mark, he will slow dramatically. Don’t hit him from
behind.
Fig. 14 – Before reaching the three length zone, luff the inside
boat to force a poor rounding; allowing you to get a position
on his quarter as you round.
Rounding Tactics
Following are some tactical tricks you can use at round-
ings. If your tactics are good coming down the leg, you should
only rarely find yourself giving room.
Use a Tactical Rounding. The inside boat is not al-
lowed to make a tactical rounding, but you still should. If
you are giving room, swing wide and follow on the inside
boat’s transom, rather than pinwheel to the outside. If you
pinwheel you may end up blanketed with no way to escape.
(See Figs. 10 & 11.)
No Brakes! As you swing wide to follow, be careful not
to hit the lead boat from behind as you accelerate. His sharp
turn at the mark may leave him dead in the water. As the lead
boat, it is a good idea to slow down and force the outside boat
to the outside (Fig. 13).
Force a Bad Rounding. When you are giving room,
you can try to force the inside boat into a bad (in close and
out wide) rounding by sailing high as you approach the mark.
If you force the inside boat onto a high line approaching the
mark, she will have trouble making a good rounding. You can
then take room as necessary to round into a controlling position
coming out of the turn (Fig. 14).
Watch for Vultures. When you are giving room warn
those behind you not to cut in. Plenty of advance dialogue
(and threats) may be necessary to ward off those not entitled to
room. Tell them early, before they’ve decided to try to force
their way in (Fig. 15).
The Big Wheel. If you are on the outside of three or
four boats with others close behind, you can follow inside or
sail around the outside. If you cut in, you may be required to
give room to late arrivers. Your strategy for the next leg can
help you plan whether to pinwheel outside or try to cut inside
(Fig. 16).

-- 167 of 191 --

Chapter 11: Downwind Rules, Mark Roundings, and Finishing 	Page 161
Negotiate Early. Do not wait until the three boat length
zone to start negotiations, especially at a crowded rounding.
Tell all boats nearby what you expect, and be sure to warn
potential vultures against forcing their way through. Appoint
a spokesman to handle inter-boat dialogue. While one crew
member negotiates your rights, the rest of the crew should keep
sailing (Fig. 17).
Room or Starboard? At starboard roundings and star-
board gates, inside port tack boats are entitled to mark-room
once they reach the zone (Fig. 18).
Many places (and races) are won and lost at the corners.
To win you must position yourself carefully, negotiate diplo-
matically, and handle your boat smoothly.

11.4 Finishing Rules & Tactics
Finishing Tactics depend on what kind of race you are in.
In one design or level-rated racing, your goal is to finish ahead
of as many boats as possible; finishing tactics are then similar
to positioning tactics approaching a mark. In handicap rac-
ing, the goal is to finish as soon as possible; in this case avoid
boat-on-boat duels and sprint to the finish. There are times in
handicap races when a level-rated competitor is close at hand
and both situations apply simultaneously.
Finishing Tactics Upwind
You should shoot the finish by turning up into irons and
coasting the last boat length or two. By shooting you are able
to shorten the distance sailed while coasting at nearly full speed
(Fig. 19).
A finish line has a favored end, much like a starting line.
When finishing upwind, the favored end is the end furthest
downwind – opposite of the favored end for a start. Your fin-
ishing tactics then focus on the laylines to the favored end.
As you approach the finish, you want to stay below all
laylines until you have determined which end is favored; then
only the favored end laylines are significant.
There are several ways to determine the favored end. If
it is the old starting line, you can determine the favored end
based on the line bearing and the present wind. If it is a new
line, then you must make your determination based on obser-
vation. If you cannot figure out the favored end by observing
boats ahead—such are the burdens of leadership—then your
own tacking angles can tell you which end is favored. If port

are like windward mark tactics with

tack is more nearly parallel to the line and starboard more
nearly perpendicular, then the port end of the line is favored; as
you pass under the port end you would be sailing extra distance
parallel to the line, and vice versa. (See Figs. 20 and 21.)
Upwind Finishing Rules
The rules at an upwind finish are like those at an upwind
mark rounding. Starboard/port prevails, and a windward boat
may call for room if overlapped at the three length zone. You
are not required to cross a finish line. Once any part of the boat
or equipment crosses the line you may clear yourself in any
direction, provided you do not interfere with those still racing
(Fig. 22).
Finishing Tactics Downwind
Finishing tactics downwind focus on the favored end, just
as they do upwind. We want to sail proper reaching angles and
finish at the favored (upwind) end (Fig. 23).
Tactics to reach the favored end are the same as those
approaching any leeward mark. Clear air is essential to good
speed. A finish line does offer some flexibility though. If the
line is near square, you have some latitude on where to go in
search of clear air.
You can shoot the finish downwind and coast twice as far
as you would upwind. Bear off to a run and coast to the line
with your reaching speed (Fig. 23).
Downwind Finishing Rules
The rules at the finish line are the same as those on the
course; near the marks the mark-room rules apply (Fig. 24).
Fig. 24 – Near the ends, mark-room
rules prevail. At the middle of the line,
the downwind sailing rules govern.
Fig. 23 – The upwind end is favored for a
downwind fi nish. Sail proper angles and
shoot the fi nish by coasting on a run.
Fig. 22 – Rules at an upwind fi nish are
the same as those at a windward mark:
Starboard/Port for boats on opposite tacks;
mark-room for boats on the same tack.

11.5 Quiz Questions and Skill Building
1. How do the windward / leeward rules at starts differ from
the rules on reaches and runs?
2. A boat with no overlap calls for room. What should you do?
3. A windward boat mast abeam hails “Mast Abeam.” How
should you respond (aside from suggesting he buy a new rule
book)?
4. When might you need to slow down as you approach a
mark?
5. If you are the outside trailing boat, does it matter if you
have an overlap with an inside boat?
6. In a mixed fl eet, whose boat lengths are used for the three-
length-zone?
Wide-and-close turns are the best route around marks.
Practice them all the time—under sail and under power—even
in your car. You will quickly learn your boat’s appropriate
turning radius. Remember, a wide smooth turn carries speed.
It is also good to practice jamming a tight turn around a
mark— coming in close and trying to stay close by jamming
your turn. Practice accelerating out of the turn.
There are also times when you will need to slow down—such
as when you are inside but NOT entitled to room. You’ll need
to stall and let the outside (lead) boat pass. Oversteering is
the best way to do this. (For some this requires no practice.)
Another way is by over-trimming.
Time speed distance test. With your spinnaker fl ying, sail past
a mark and start a stopwatch. Go through your mark rounding
routine:. Upwind controls on, jib up, spinnaker down, and turn
upwind. How long did it take, in time and distance?

Quiz Answers
1. How do the windward / leeward rules at starts differ from
the rules on reaches and runs?
As they are written, there is no difference. In practice,
there is a difference in that there is no proper course be-
fore the start. In all cases, the leeward boat has the right
of way (Rule 11), and may alter course provided she
gives the windward boat room to keep clear (Rule 16.1).
2. A boat with no overlap calls for room. What should you do?
First, try to talk him out of it. If he forces his way in, give
room and protest – do not deny room, and do not get
into a collision.
3. A windward boat hails “Mast Abeam.” How should you
respond (aside from suggesting he buy a new rule book)?
Turn towards him, and when he hails and fails to respond,
protest. The mast abeam rule was dropped in the last
century.
4. When might you need to slow down as you approach a
mark?
To keep from going inside when you are not entitled to
room, or to keep an outside boat overlapped to the out-
side, so they can’t cut inside and claim room.
5. If you are the outside trailing boat, does it matter if you
have an overlap with an inside boat?
Yes. If you are an outside, leeward boat, then the inside
boat is entitled to room for a safe rounding. If you lose
the overlap, the inside boat becomes clear ahead, and is
entitled make a tactical (in wide, out close) rounding,
which will make it much tougher for you to round and
have clear air.
6. In a mixed fl eet, whose boat lengths are used for the three-
length-zone?
Your boat lengths. You give room to boats overlapped
inside you when you reach your three-length-zone. Each
boat uses its own lengths.

CHAPTER 	12: NO 	MORE 	TACTICS
12.1 The Trouble with Tactics…
The trouble with tactics is that you have to deal constantly
with factors you can’t predict or control. Strategy, which is
based on wind and weather, obviously has a high degree of
uncertainty, particularly for the narrow coastal areas in which
most of us sail. Yet the weather is relatively tame compared
to the erratic behavior of your competitors, around whom you
must base your tactics. These people are clearly irrational—af-
ter all, they choose to spend their leisure time, and considable
funds, going nowhere at 6 miles an hour!
At the same time, tactics have an enormous impact on
race results. As we have seen, hundreds of yards can be gained
(or lost) in a matter of minutes. The weather, and your ability
to predict it, has a big impact on racing success.
By comparison, boat handling and boat speed are quite
pedestrian. Performance differences are measured in tenths of
a knot. A better tack may save you half a boat length. While a
wind shift may bring a huge gain (or loss) in a matter of mo-
ments, gains from boat speed accrue slowly, over time.
The upside of boat speed and boat handling is that they
are completely within your control. You don’t need to rely on
any outside factors, or predict the unpredictable. Your boat
handling and boat speed can be good every day.
In the performance pyramid, boat handling is the base.
You won’t be able to race successfully until you can sail well:
get sails up and down, tack and jibe, accelerate, and maneuver
without hesitation. Your boat handling must be second nature,
so you can pick your head up, look around, and do tactics.
Boat speed is the next building block. If you are fast,
you’ll soon find you are clever tactically. If you are slow, then
tactics won’t save you.
Often racers lamenting tactical woes actually have boat
handling and boat speed problems. If they are slow off the
starting line, and are forced to tack away to the unfavored side,
that is not a tactical problem.

THE PERFORMANCE PYRAMID :
Not only do Boat Handling and Boat Speed form the base of
the pyramid, they are also performance factors entirely within
our control. Tactics, on the other hand, involves weather and
other boats—factors which are decidedly unpredictable.
!
Conclusion: Good luck in all your racing…
… and don’t believe everything you read!!
When your boat handling is second nature, and your boat
speed is second to none, you will find that, all of a sudden, you
are a tactical wizard.
You should use tactics and strategy to advantage when
you have an edge—when you can predict what is going on and
control events. When you can’t predict what is going to hap-
pen, your best tactic is to minimize the impact of weather, and
focus your attention on boat handling and boat speed.
Often the best strategic objective is to minimize the im-
pact of the unknown and let your boat speed prevail. Tactically
this means putting your boat in a position where you can sail
full speed, in clear air, free from crowds; yet without sailing to
the strategically fraught edges of the course.
12.2 The End
Part of the attraction of sailboat racing is its complexity.
From athletic to intellectual, from interpersonal to introspec-
tive, from reflex to endurance—we are challenged in every
way. When you have mastered all the skills, you can quit. Until
then, keep trying.
As you work to master the skills, never let the theory get
in the way of what actually works. Let the theory serve as a
starting point, not an end. Keep testing, keep working to find
what works. Then make up a theory to explain it…
Remember that this is, in the end, a sailboat race. On a
good day you may win a sailboat race. On a bad day, generally
the worst thing that will happen is you lose a sailboat race.
Finally, thank you for reading RegattaFlow Playbook. Tactics; I hope
you have enjoyed it. In parting let me wish you luck in your

A PPENDIX 1: LEARNING T HE R ULES
App. 1.1 The Rules
This chapter will introduce and answer a few questions
about the rules. Specific rules and situations are covered in the
chapters related to the situation (i.e., upwind rules are covered
in Chapter 8: Upwind Tactics).
The fundamental goal of the rules is to prevent collisions.
Our racing rules are derivative of The Rules of the Road which
govern shipping. But the purpose of the rules goes beyond
“preventing collisions at sea.”
As Dave Perry explains it, “the rules are the game. With-
out rules we would have no game. If we don’t sail by the same
rules, we are not playing the same game.”
It is true, the right-of-way rules are basically the same
as the rules used to prevent collisions between ships at sea.
But they do much more. From the rules, we get much of our
close-quartered tactics, for it is the rules which define what we
can and cannot do. Furthermore, the rules are more than just
right-of-way rules. The Racing Rules of Sailing cover how
races are to be run and how violations are handled. The rules
also govern sailing situations which do not involve right of way
between boats.
While any racing sailor should be familiar with the full
rule book, we will start by covering the Right of Way rules,
their General Limitations, and the Mark Room rules.
The US Sailing rule book runs 153 pages, yet all the Right
of Way Rules fit on a single page, the General Limitations take
one additional page, and the Mark Room rules take two pages.
App. 1.2 The Four Right of Way Rules
Their are only four right-of-way rules. If you are new to
the rules, you should start by learning these. They cover most
situations. Once these are clear look at the four General Limi-
tations which temper the right of way and govern the transi-
tions and conflicts between the right of way rules.
Rule 10: On Opposite Tacks
A port-tack boat shall keep clear.
The starboard–port rule is one we use every race. It ap-
plies whenever boats are on opposite tacks, even if one is sail-
ing close-hauled and the other is running.
A close crossing situation upwind is a common source of
protests, and the port-tack boat rarely survives such a protest.
What the port-tack boat sees as a clear crossing the starboard-
tack boat may see as an unacceptable risk. (Fig. 1)

Rule 11: On the Same Tack, Overlapped
A windward boat shall keep clear.
The windward–leeward rule is one of the simplest in the
book. The leeward boat has right of way and the windward
boat must keep clear (Fig. 2a). This rule applies to all boats
on the same tack and overlapped even if they are on different
points of sail (Fig. 2b).
Wow. We are half way through the Right of Way rules.
Rule 12: On the Same Tack, Not Overlapped
A boat clear astern shall keep clear.
An overtaking boat must keep clear of a boat clear ahead.
This rule, like the windward–leeward rule, applies to boats on
the same tack regardless of point of sail (Fig. 3).
To differentiate Rules 11 & 12 we need to define an over-
lap: A boat is clear astern if she is aft of a line abeam of the
stern of the boat clear ahead. Otherwise, they are overlapped
(Fig. 4).
Once again, while the rule itself is straightforward, the
transitions to windward–leeward and starboard–port are ad-
dressed in General Limitations.
Rule 13: While Tacking
A tacking boat shall keep clear of other boats.
Rule 13 actually starts, “After passing head to wind..”.
During the initial part of tacking – from close-hauled to head to
wind – the rule does not apply. It is only during the second half
of the tack – from head to wind until she is on the new close-
hauled course that the rule kicks in. If you head up from close-
hauled and then abort the tack and bear off to your old course,
then you have not tacked, and Rule 13 never applies.
The most common infraction of Rule 13 occurs when a

port tack boat tacks in front of a starboard tacker. For the tack
to be legal S must be able to hold course until P completes her
tack before starting an evasive maneuver (Fig. 5).
Consider this before you tack in front of a starboard boat:
Suppose S starts her evasive maneuver earlier than she had to.
How are you going to prove she could have waited?
Right of Way Rules
So that’s it: All four Right of Way rules. The only right of
way rules in the entire 153 page rule book. Next we’ll take a
look at the General Limitations. Only four of them too.
App. 1.3 General Limitations
The four right of way rules are limited by four General
Limitations in Rules 14 –17. These limitations constrain the
Right of Way boat and also govern the transition between Right
of Way rules. Here they are:
Rule 14: Avoiding Contact
Even if you have the right of way, you must avoid contact
with other boats. Once it is clear that the keep clear boat is not
keeping clear you must act to avoid contact.
Rule 15: Acquiring Right of Way
“When a boat acquires right of way, she shall initially give
the other boat room to keep clear, unless she acquires right of
way through the other boat’s actions.”
A couple of examples: One is a boat coming from astern
and acquiring an overlap to leeward. As the overtaking boat
establishes her overlap she must allow the newly burdened boat
room and time to keep clear (Fig. 6a).
Two others involve tacking: With two boats on port, when
one tacks to starboard she must allow the newly burdened boat
room and time to keep clear, as above. With two boats on star-

long as she gives the keep clear boat room to do so.
board, when one tacks to port she is not afforded any room or
time, as she created her own burden (Fig. 6b).
Rule 16: Changing Course
“16.1 When a right-of-way boat changes course, she shall
give the other boat room to keep clear.” As with Rule 15, Rule
16.1 (and 16.2, which further constrains a starboard boat when
a port-tack boat is ducking) provides the keep clear boat with
time to adjust to changing circumstances. The most common
situation where this rule comes into play is when leeward boat
luffs a windward boat. With a substantial overlap the leeward
boat can luff aggressively and the windward boat must re-
spond. With a small overlap of Leeward’s bow to Windward’s
stern, Leeward must allow room for Windward’s stern to swing
down as Windward responds to Leeward’s attack (Fig. 7).
Rule 17: On the Same Tack; Proper Course
This one can be a bit confusing: If a leeward boat got
her overlap from clear astern she is not allowed to sail above
proper course. Note that this does not change the right of way
– the windward boat must still keep clear – it just constrains the
leeward boat to a course no higher than the course she would
sail if the windward boat were not there (Fig. 8).
What’s the rationale? I’m not sure; but here’s one thought:
If an overtaking boat tries passing to windward the leeward
boat can head up to defend her air; whereas if the overtaking
boat passes to leeward she is not allowed to luff. In the first
case the boat is allowed to defend her air – a defensive posture.
Whereas an overtaking boat is not allowed to attack. The rules

App. 1.4 Mark-Room and Other Rules
Rule 18 covers Mark Room. Portions can be quite com-
plex and the language confusing to the point where you can
lose track of the major points. Here are the essentials:
When boats are overlapped, the inside boats gets room.
When boats are overlapped when the first of them reaches
the three boat length zone, the inside boats gets room even if
the overlap is later broken (Fig. 9).
When boats are NOT overlapped when the first of them
reaches the three boat length zone, the clear ahead boats gets
room even if an overlap is later established (Fig. 9).
Rule 18 does NOT apply between boats on opposite tacks
at a windward mark. The regular Port/ Starboard rule applies
(Fig. 10).
Mark-Room is covered in more detail in Chapter 8: Up-
wind Tactics and Chapter 11: Downwind Rules, Mark Round-
ings and Finishing.
A Few Other Rules
While the Right-of-Way Rules which govern situations
when boats meet, get most of the attention, there are other rules
you need to know.
There are Fundamental Rules in Part 1 of the Rule Book
which address safety, fairness, and responsibility, and the rules
of Part 3, which detail how races are run. There are rules on
scoring, and on the conduct of protest hearings, and special
rules for match racing and team racing.
Rule 44 explains the Penalties for Breaking Rules. Usu-
ally if you interfere with another boat then you must do a Two
Turns Penalty. If you hit a mark, a one turn penalty is required.
(Fig. 11).
One of my favorite parts of the Rule Book is Appendix H
which explains the procedures for weighing wet clothing.
We won’t rewrite the rule book here. Get one and read up.
The best time is early April, before sailing season, when you
should be doing your taxes.

Sidebar: Do the Rules Make Sense?
Do the Right of Way Rules make sense?
Working backwards, would it be better if Rule 13
gave a tacking boat the Right of Way, and the other
boats had to keep clear? I think not. How about re-
versing Rule 12, so a boat in front had to keep clear of
an overtaking boat coming from clear astern? Nah.
The rationale for the Rule 11: Same Tack, Over-
lapped revolves around clear air: The windward boat is
in clear air, while the leeward boat’s wind may be blan-
keted, compromising her maneuverability. The more
maneuverable windward boat must keep clear.
And what about Rule 10: Opposite Tacks? Well,
somebody has to have the Right of Way! But there’s
more to it than that: Old ships would dock with their
port side against the dock, opposite their steerboard
(starboard) side which had the rudder (when rudders
were not on centerline), keeping the rudder in deep wa-
ter. Thus, on port tack the ship would heel to starboard,
immersing the rudder; while on starboard tack the rud-
der would be lifted and maneuverability compromised.
Thus, the more maneuverable port-tack boat must keep
clear. Great story, and it might even be true.
App. 1.5 Appeals and Protests
Q. What are the Appeals?
A. When you join US Sailing, you will get a rule book.
You will also want to get a copy of the US Sailing Appeals and
International Sailing Federation (ISAF) Cases.. The Appeals
and Cases provide clarification and interpretation of the rules.
As you become comfortable with the basic workings of
the rules you can develop a more thorough understanding by
studying the appeals and cases.
Download or order the appeals at:
http://raceadmin.ussailing.org/Appeals.htm
Download the International Cases at:
Go To: www.sailing.org/ 	and search “case book”
Q. What do I need to know about Protests?
A. Sooner or later you are going to have to defend your
actions on the race course before a jury. Obviously you will
want an understanding of the rules. More importantly, you will
need to present your information about the incident in a clear,
precise manner. Give facts, not generalizations. Be specific.
Listen carefully to what others say and question anything you
disagree with. Search for inconsistencies in the story offered
by others.
Sit in on protest hearings. The process is described in
the Rule Book Appendix M. It helps to sit in on hearings and
watch the rules in action. Most juries and parties to a protest
will allow you to observe (in silence). Protest hearings range
from boring to fascinating. Observing a hearing can give you
some insight into the application of the rules. It will also be
invaluable preparation for the day you are a party to a protest.

How Are We Doing So Far?
In the final legs of a race, take the times of boats as they
round the marks and figure out corrected positions. If you
are saving your time on the fleet, then conservative tactics are
called for; if you are behind on corrected time, then a more dar-
ing strategy may be in order (Fig. 1).
C HAPTER 14: S PECIAL T OPICS
App 2.1 Mixed Fleet Racing
The Strategic Imbalance
The type of fleet you race in will effect your tactics. One-
design or level-rated competition is more tactical. Your clos-
est rivals are the boats nearby. In racing with a wide spread of
handicaps, your closest rival may not be within reach. In fact,
with some scoring systems the final handicaps aren’t figured
out until after the race when conditions are entered.
Handicap racing is strategic. You race the clock, not
boats. Stay clear of other boats and get around the course fast.
The only exception is approaching the finish near a level-rated
competitor. In that situation, you must balance the tactical con-
cerns for finishing in front of the rival with the overall strategy
of beating the clock in a mixed handicap fleet.
Small Fry & Big Fish
When racing a relatively small boat in a mixed fleet, there
is a tendency to get pushed to the side in search of clear air, as
the larger boats take up the center. The smaller boats must pay
particular attention to finding lanes of clear air in which to pur-
sue strategy. A degree of patience is also called for. Sitting in
the bad air of a bigger, faster boat may be tolerable for a short
time, if it allows you to go the right way.
The challenge for big boats is to stay clear of the smaller
boats. Big boats do well if they can get away clean at the start.
If they get caught up in the crowd, they suffer.
When a smaller boat can hang on upwind and the next leg
is a reach, they often should get into the Get Passed Lane. See
Chapter 9: Reaching Strategy and Tactics for details.
Fig. 1 - Racing in a handicap fl eet puts an emphasis on
strategy. You are racing against the clock, and your nearest
rival may be nowhere in sight. One-design racing is more
tactical. The boats nearby are your biggest concern. In a
mixed fl eet, take times at marks to see how you are doing on
corrected time against your closest rivals.

the marks, and start your buoy room discussions early to keep
things orderly in your crowd. Speed and boat handling reign.
Go Home a Winner
Going to a big time regatta for the first time can be an eye
opening experience. If you go in humble, you may be able to
save yourself from humiliation. Try to achieve consistency and
you will do well—at some events, finishing in the top ten every
race wins the regatta. Take some time to look at the boats of
the top sailors, and talk with them about technique. Learn your
lessons at the championship, and use your new skills to beat up
on the competition back home.
Fig. 2 - There is a strong emphasis on fundamentals when
racing in a big fl eet. At the back of a big fl eet, sailing up the
middle will leave you gasping for air.
App 2.2 Big Fleet Racing
The transition from the regular weekend fleet to a cham-
pionship fleet can be painful. Big fleet tactics differ in several
ways from tactics in moderate sized fleets. The first difference
is that the penalties for even slight mistakes are magnified. Big
fleet racing emphasizes the fundamentals: great speed, sound
strategy, and fluid boat handling.
Starts
Starts become increasingly critical. You must get off the
line with clear air and good speed. At the same, time starts be-
come increasingly difficult. It is easy to get lost in the crowd,
and easy to underestimate the effects of turbulence and bad air
on your approach.
You’ve got to push hard to keep clear air. A luffing start is
often the only way to stay in the front row. Once you fall into
bad air, you may never recover (Fig. 2).
Sailing off the line is a sprint to keep clear air. Just sail
fast. The tactician can watch to see how the breeze is settling
in, but it won’t matter if you aren’t in the front row.
Up The Beat
If you find yourself going the wrong way early, you’ll
have to wait until things open up during the first half of the
beat to remedy the problem.
As the fleet converges at the windward mark, the middle
of the course becomes a mess of boats, chop, and turbulence.
If you are not in the top ten, avoid the middle as you approach
the mark. Overstand to get well clear of the crowds. (The
trick, of course, is to arrive in the top ten rather than the middle
twenty. Life is tough in the rat race.)
Downwind
You must defend your air. If one boat rolls over you, ten
may go by before you recover. Work for inside position at
Gasp!

Fig. 3 - The fundamental distance racing strategy is to sail
toward the mark. One reason to modify fundamental strategy
is in order to sail fast. By sailing an angle slightly off the
rhumb line, we may be able to sail dramatically faster and be
closer to the fi nish line when the next weather change arrives.
extra distance you sail in a 100 mile race by sailing 5, 10, 15,
and 20° off course for half the distance to the finish, and then
aiming at the finish:
° Off Course 	Distance Sailed
0 	100 miles
5 	100.4
10 	101.5
15 	103.5
20 	106.4
On a 35 foot boat, in 10 knots of wind, bearing off 10°
from close hauled will increase speed from about 6 knots to 6.6
knots. By sailing 1.5% further you go 10% faster! Heading up
10° from a broad reach creates the same result. A 20° change
of course adds less than 7% extra distance! Sail Fast (Fig. 3).
App 2.3 Distance Racing Strategy
Success in distance racing is more than a simple exten-
sion of round-the-buoys technique. Strategy involves a bigger
picture of weather changes over a period of days. Crew orga-
nization includes setting a watch system to take advantage of
your crew’s skills. Motivation changes as you are often racing
against the clock, out of sight of your nearest rivals. Concerns
about safety, provisioning, and health demand added atten-
tion. The basic principles of success around the buoys remain
intact—sail fast, go the right direction—but achieving these
objectives becomes a more involved process.
There are six basic elements to distance racing strategy.
They start with the fundamental approach of sailing to the fin-
ish. To that we will add strategies for sailing fast, planning for
weather, and boat-for-boat positioning. We will also look at
special strategies for catching up from behind and night sailing.
Sail Toward the Finish
Draw a line from the start to the finish. Follow that line.
This may not sound like a real breakthrough, but more races
are won with this strategy than any other. Use this strategy as
your starting point, and modify from there. When in doubt, re-
turn to this approach (but not to the original line): Draw a new
rhumb line from your present position, and follow it.
Sail Fast
Sail fast means more than sailing our best, straight up the
rhumb line. Usually we can sail substantially faster by sailing
a few degrees off the rhumb line. The goal is to get as close
to the finish line as fast as we can. Sailing straight down the
rhumb line may not do it.
By sailing up (or down) 10° off the rhumb line, we may
get closer to the finish line faster. Sailing 10° off the rhumb
line increases our sailing distance by less than 2%. If our speed
is more than 2% faster 10° off course, then we may be better
off sailing off the rhumb line. Here are some numbers on the
60 miles

Chapter 14: Special Topics 	Page 181
The old adage “what goes up must come down” (or vice
versa) does not necessarily apply. In a distance race the weath-
er will change. Who knows what will be up and what will be
down tomorrow morning? All things being equal, you want to
be closer to the finish line.
To sail fast means you want to avoid sailing upwind and
downwind during a distance race. If the finish is upwind, sail
fast beat mode—foot off, never pinch—on the favored tack,
or toward the next new wind. If the course is downwind, then
tack downwind at optimum angles.
Our goal is to be the closest boat to the finish line when
the weather conditions change. By sailing a little faster on a
course slightly off the rhumb line, we can achieve that goal.
The only time we lose is if the weather never changes.
Which leads us to our next strategy modifier: The weather.
Weather Strategy
Navigators define a distance race as a race through a series
of weather changes. One of the tricks to weather strategy is to
make good use of the forecast. From my experience, one les-
son on weather strategy stands out above all else: Sail the wind,
not the forecast.
Coastal forecasting is notoriously difficult. Changes in
the weather, and the pace with which they will occur, are hard
to predict. Many distance races have been lost by boats in
perfect position for a change that arrives while the victors are
drinking champagne.
Distance racing requires an understanding of weather and
weather system movements over the duration of the race. In
order to plan long term strategy, you must have the big picture
of what the weather will do. Get all the weather information
you can, from every available source, and keep a record of the
forecasts. It is best to start tracking the weather a few days (or
weeks) before the race to get a sense of how the systems are
moving.
Tracking the forecasts for several days prior to the race
will help you see trends in the forecast. If, for example, an
early forecast predicts a front 24 hours into the race, and a
more recent forecast suggests the front will arrive 36 hours into
the race, then you can guess that the weather system movement
is slowing (and perhaps the front will never arrive).
During the race update your forecast with weather radio,
your own observations (is the barometer changing as fore-
cast?), and via the Internet. If you can set your boat up to have
web access during a distance race, then you can get weather
data and forecasts from NOAA and other public sites.
One skill you need is the ability to interpret forecasts and
apply them to your specific area. During the race, tracking
reported conditions in the area will help you distill the forecast.
By tracking reported conditions you can chart the advance of
changing weather, judge its pace, and predict its impact on your
specific area.
Your basic strategy should remain a race to the finish, in
the existing conditions, until you can confidently predict what
will happen to the weather, and when. Only then should you
modify your strategy to suit the predicted weather.
When you are confident of the forecast what should you
do? As conditions change you want to be 1) the boat closest to
the finish 2) the boat closest to the new wind.
Here’s an example: Day two the 1987 Annapolis to New-
port race. We’re in the midst of a glorious spinnaker surf, roar-
ing along on starboard jibe in 20-25 knots of wind, somewhere
off the Jersey shore. The weather radio is forecasting contin-
ued southerlies and sweltering conditions.
Thomas Dolby is raging from the Rick’s boom box: We’ll
be the Pirate Twins Again. The tape ends and auto ejects.
WCBS News Radio 88 AM takes over from New York. We are
still out of range of the New York NOAA station, but WCBS
forecasts relief from the heat wave, and north winds by sunset.

-- 188 of 191 --

Page 182 	RegattaFlow Playbook. Racing Tactics
“Beautiful sleeping weather” the weatherman raves, “A break
from the heat.”
Hearing this forecast, we split jibes to the north and meet
the front shortly after sunset, in position to close reach along
the coast, while the boats offshore are beating upwind. Never
mind sleep. It is a beautiful night for racing (Fig. 4).
Moral: Use every available source to get the most up-to-
date weather information available. Only when you know what
the weather will do should you alter your strategy.
Boat-for-Boat Strategy
Stay with the fleet. Until you have reason to do other-
wise, and you are sure you are right, stay with the fleet. This is
particularly true early in the race. You are better off to sail with
the fleet (and sail fast) in the early going. You want to enter the
final segment of the race in a position to win. An early gamble
can quickly turn a long race into a long delivery.
As the race progresses and you refine your weather fore-
cast, try to lead the fleet to the new wind. The first boat to the
new wind gets the biggest advantage from it. If you are sailing
upwind this usually means footing toward the shift, rather than
sailing hard on the wind. If you are sailing downwind, then
it pays to reach up a little extra to get to the shift. On a reach,
find the fastest reaching angle to carry you to the new breeze.
Sometimes the best strategy is to lock on to your chief
rivals in the race and simply sail against them. Having a com-
petitor close at hand keeps everyone more attentive.
Strategy from Behind
If you are behind, there are a couple of options to con-
sider. One is to simply follow the competition and drag them
down from behind with superior speed. Over a long haul a
little speed advantage adds up—don’t be impatient.
The other option is to sail fast regardless of the angle.
Your goal should be to reach to a position abeam of the com-
petition—translate your distance behind into height. In a short
Fig. 4 - Weather Strategy: The basic idea is, Sail to the new
wind. The danger is sailing the forecast, when it may not come
true. Sail the wind you’ve got until you are confident in the
forecast; then go to the new wind.
In the Annapolis to Newport Race several years ago a cold
front came off the New England coast the second night out.
Boats which had worked to a position inshore were able close
reach in the new wind, while boats offshore had to sail hard on
the wind.

likely. Keep the boat organized. Before dark, do your house-
keeping and make sure things are in order. Clear clutter, check
your coils and sail packing, pre-navigate so you know what to
expect. If you need to run your engine to charge the ship’s bat-
teries, it is best to do that during daylight hours too.
Finishing Strategy
Once the last weather change has occurred, distance rac-
ing strategy becomes short course strategy. When a level-rated
rival emerges in the predawn light on the final morning of a
long race, it is exciting to be aboard as adrenaline kicks in and
carries you to the finish.
Two notes of caution: First, don’t start your sprint to the
finish so early that the entire crew collapses before the end;
enforce the watch system until the last watch. Also, remember
that you are racing the clock as well as the boats you can see.
Avoid getting caught up in a feud with one other boat.
Conclusion: Putting it All Together
A winning strategy is only one ingredient to successful
distance racing. Distance racing involves a whole series of
new challenges, from crew organization and provisioning to
night sailing and safety considerations.
There is great satisfaction simply in sailing well and
finishing a long race. There is a greater thrill to take up the
challenge and return victorious.
race, this is not likely to work because “what goes up must
come down” etc. But in a distance race conditions will change;
the height could as easily become an advantage as a burden
(Fig. 5).
Night Strategy
Distance races are often won at night. Become nocturnal.
Sail hard during the day; sail harder at night to overcome the
difficulties of darkness. A watch system which allows longer
sleep during the day and shorter watches at night is preferred.
Three four-hour watches by day, and four three-hour watches
by night works well.
Be conservative. Be ready for the next change. Without
the visual clues available in daylight, sudden changes are more
Fig. 5 - Strategy from behind. If you have superior speed, then
be patient and drag them down from behind. If speed alone
won’t do it, then try to convert your distance behind into lateral
distance. Sail a course high or low of rhumb line for extra
speed. The lateral separation could work to your advantage
in a favorable shift or change in the weather; whereas an
unfavorable shift may simply put you back where you were.
