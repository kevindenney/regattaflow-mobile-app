## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Starting Rules are a mix of the regular racing rules—
such as starboard / port, overtaking, and While Tacking—
which always apply; and special rules which apply only
during starts (Fig. 1). These special rules include exemption
from the Mark Room and Obstruction Rules (Section C
preamble), restarting (Rules 21.1 & 29.1), and the one minute
rule (Rule 30.1). The luffing rules are now the same before
starts as they are during the race though in practice some dif-
ferences remain as we shall see.
If you'd like an overview of the rules and their underly-
ing principles, jump to Chapter 12 - Learning the Rules.
5.1 Luffing at Starts
As written, the luffing rules are the same before starts as
they are during the race. In practice there are differences, as
there is no proper course before the start.
Here is how the luffing rules work (Fig. 2):
The leeward boat has right of way (Rule 11) and may
luff as she pleases, limited only by the need to give the wind-
ward boat room to keep clear (Rule 16).
If the leeward boat established her overlap from astern,
then after the starting signal, she shall not sail above her
proper course (Rule 17).
If the windward boat established an overlap from astern,
or if the leeward boat tacked into the overlap, then she may
luff and she may sail above her proper course even after the
starting signal. (Why she would want to is another question.)
When you find yourself as a windward boat in a luffing
situation, the definition of keep clear requires that you re-
spond promptly to a luff. Head up as far and as fast as possi-
ble or necessary. Failure to respond to a luff will likely result
Fig. 1 - Starting Rules are a mix of regular racing rules and
special rules which apply only at starts.
Definitions:
The definitions in the Racing Rules of Sailing can clarify
some common confusion and misunderstanding of the rules.
Proper Course is the course a boat would sail to finish as
quickly as possible in the absence of the other boats referred to.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
