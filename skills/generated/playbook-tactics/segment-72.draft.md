to changes in the tide.
Changes with Wind Conditions
The wind can upset current predictions, particularly in
shallow water. A strong wind blowing over a long period can
overwhelm tidal effects, pushing surface water and delaying or
reversing tides. When the winds abate, the current distortions
will remain until the water has had a chance to return to level
by flowing in the direction opposite the earlier wind. Winds
can also create currents where there otherwise are none, as
mentioned above.
Effects on Sailing Wind
Current changes the sailing wind for a boat. The sailing
wind is the sum of the true wind over the bottom and the cur-
rent. When sailing upwind, the net effect of current on the wind
reinforces the effect or the current. A favorable current creates
a favorable change in the sailing wind, and an adverse current
makes for an unfavorable change in the sailing wind (Fig. 25).
Details are explained in Chapter 13: Weather.
Develop Local Knowledge
One key to success in current is to develop local knowl-
edge. Keep records of how the current runs in various wind
and tide combinations. Our strategic plan is only as good as
the information it is based on. Accurate current information is
critical to good strategic planning.
Fig. 24 – When current is not uniform, take advantage of the
shift in sailing wind. In this example we have 10 knots of wind,
1 knot of current, and boats tacking through 90°. The current
gives one boat a 6° lift, the other a 6° header. The lifted boat’s
VMG is 20% better than the headed boat’s. (VMG is normally
.71 of boat speed. The shift is 6° because arc-tan 6°=1/10.
A 6° lift creates a VMG of .78, a 6° header creates a VMG of
.63. .63/.78=.80. I’m glad you asked.)
Fig. 25 – The vector of the current is added to the true wind to
create our sailing wind.
