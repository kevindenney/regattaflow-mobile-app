Starboard Tack Fetch
When the breeze clocks to create a starboard tack fetch,
the same principles apply. Blast off the line on starboard tack.
Your position on the line is not important—getting away clean
is. Avoid the crowd at the starboard end; boats in the crowd
push each other up as they fight for clear air, and they end up
sailing extra distance. Take off from the middle of the line. You
will be ahead and to leeward of the crowd; you will be inside
(for a port rounding) if the leg becomes a fetch; and you will
lead the fleet into the header if the breeze backs. A timed out
and back approach is best (Fig. 5).
One-Legged Beats
The tactics for starts on one-legged beats boil down to
starting with speed on the tack toward the mark. Position on
the line is not important, but clear air is. This strategy applies
to any reaching start with the wind forward of the beam and the
line perpendicular to the leg.
6.4 Conclusion
Starts are critical, and offbeat starts are no exception. Off-
beat starts provide a great opportunity for those who can take
advantage of their unique characteristics. It is remarkable how
the start can shape the entire race, even a distance race. Try to
anticipate the actions of other boats, and get in position to start
with clear air and good speed.

Fig. 5 - Starboard Tack Fetch. Once again, position on the line
is not important. A fast, clear air start is the goal. Avoid the
crowd at the windward end, and take the preferred position to
leeward.
