gradually ratchetting to the right. Strategy in these conditions is to work
toward the favored side while playing the oscillations.

winds are generally shifted to the right of the surface winds (at
least in the northern hemisphere).
The effect of these geographic changes can be either per-
sistent or oscillating. In offshore winds, there will commonly
be a mixed effect—with puffs coming from shore lifting the
tack which is parallel to shore, and with those lifts being stron-
ger the closer you get to shore.
The thermal effects on an onshore wind usually create a
persistent shift from the prevailing wind direction to the normal
sea breeze direction (Fig 16).
For more on weather, see the RegattaFlow Playbook. Weather for Sailors
book and CD-ROM.
Geographic Shifts
We do most of our racing near shore, where the interaction
of the land and water affects our sailing wind. Further offshore
conditions are more stable and predictable; but along the coast
wind conditions are difficult to predict.
There are many ways the shoreline changes the wind.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
