## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

For triangle races, the reach mark is set in the middle
of the bay, south and east of Tolly Point. After rounding the
windward mark, particularly on the blustery days, the leg ap-
pears too tight for a spinnaker. Go ahead and set. Sail low on
the early part of the leg, in the strong winds from the Severn.
Later in the leg the breeze will lighten and fair, and it will be
advantageous to be able to reach up from below.
WARNING: Things don’t always work out this way on
the first reach. Sometimes a S. W. puff will come off the shore
inside Tolly Point and the boats inside will beam reach across,
while those down low struggle to reach up. It depends on the
wind direction (S. or N. of W.?) and the position of the mark
(the closer under Tolly Point the more likely S.W. puffs are to
be a factor).
The second reach across the bay is dominated by current.
The same is true of the later part of any leeward leg. The cur-
rent runs strongest near the mark. Overcorrect for the current
early to make sure you are sailing with it late in the leg. (Work
south on a flood, north on an ebb). The wind tends to be much
lighter on the Eastern Shore and you don’t want to have to fight
the current in the main channel.
In the westerlies, the wind tends to be stronger by the river
than on the eastern shore. Be ready for more breeze at the top
of the leg.
If the frontal passage is weak the sea breeze may push the
breeze to the S.W. in the afternoon. A strong front will tend to
clock the breeze to the N.W.
Northwest Wind
After a frontal passage in the fall the strong N.W. winds
provide some of the year’s best sailing. From a start in mid-
bay the windward mark is set at the mouth of Whitehall Bay or
off Hackett Pt. to the east. Coming off the line there tend to be
starboard tack lifts, with the boats up the line gaining an advan-

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
