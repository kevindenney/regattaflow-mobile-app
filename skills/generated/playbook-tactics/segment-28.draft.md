## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

4.1 Introduction
With our strategic plan set, Starting Tactics will be used to
execute a start which meets our strategic goals. Our goal is to
arrive at the selected section of the line at the gun at full speed
with clear air and no interference from other competitors. No
mean feat ( Fig. 1).
This chapter will look first at the tactical information we
need and how to gather it. Next, we will look at the start it-
self—those final fractions of a minute which can unravel the
best laid plan. This section includes the final approach, the
critical sprint off the line, and some common pitfalls.
4.2 Tactical Information
We gather tactical information (Fig. 2) about the line to
help us execute our approach. This is different from the stra-
tegic information we gathered to decide where on the line to
start.
The information we need includes:
The timed sailing length of the starting line (Fig. 2a).
This information will help us judge our timing as we set
up for our start and as we make our final run at the line.
It can also help us figure out if other boats are close
enough to pose a threat to our plans.
Laylines to each end of the line (Fig. 2b,c).
Knowing the layline to each end, particularly if you
plan to start near the end, will help you set up. Obvious-
ly, you want to be inside the right end layline to avoid
barging, and inside the left layline to fetch. But you also
can use the layline to position yourself up or down the
line. For example, if you want to start five boat lengths
down the line, you need to make your turn five lengths
after crossing the layline, not five lengths after passing
under the end of the line.
Line Sights off each end of the line (Fig. 2c).
Line sights to each end of the line can help us judge
how close to the line we are. This is particularly use-
ful for midline starts or when other boats obstruct our
view of one end. Compass bearings are not an effective

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
