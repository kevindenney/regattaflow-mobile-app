Sidebar: Do the Rules Make Sense?
Do the Right of Way Rules make sense?
Working backwards, would it be better if Rule 13
gave a tacking boat the Right of Way, and the other
boats had to keep clear? I think not. How about re-
versing Rule 12, so a boat in front had to keep clear of
an overtaking boat coming from clear astern? Nah.
The rationale for the Rule 11: Same Tack, Over-
lapped revolves around clear air: The windward boat is
in clear air, while the leeward boat’s wind may be blan-
keted, compromising her maneuverability. The more
maneuverable windward boat must keep clear.
And what about Rule 10: Opposite Tacks? Well,
somebody has to have the Right of Way! But there’s
more to it than that: Old ships would dock with their
port side against the dock, opposite their steerboard
(starboard) side which had the rudder (when rudders
were not on centerline), keeping the rudder in deep wa-
ter. Thus, on port tack the ship would heel to starboard,
immersing the rudder; while on starboard tack the rud-
der would be lifted and maneuverability compromised.
Thus, the more maneuverable port-tack boat must keep
clear. Great story, and it might even be true.
App. 1.5 Appeals and Protests
Q. What are the Appeals?
A. When you join US Sailing, you will get a rule book.
You will also want to get a copy of the US Sailing Appeals and
International Sailing Federation (ISAF) Cases.. The Appeals
and Cases provide clarification and interpretation of the rules.
As you become comfortable with the basic workings of
the rules you can develop a more thorough understanding by
studying the appeals and cases.

Download the International Cases at:
Go To: www.sailing.org/ 	and search “case book”
Q. What do I need to know about Protests?
A. Sooner or later you are going to have to defend your
actions on the race course before a jury. Obviously you will
want an understanding of the rules. More importantly, you will
need to present your information about the incident in a clear,

## Conversion Checklist
