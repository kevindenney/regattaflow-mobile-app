reduced frequency of wind shifts downwind. One is the chal-
lenge of finding these infrequent shifts (which we will get to,
momentarily, I promise). The second consequence is that oscil-
lating shifts upwind may become persistent shifts downwind, at
least for the duration of the leg.
Fig. 10c – The Wind Graphs for the Race Committee and a
boat in the race show the apparent compression and elongation
of the wind shift frequency as the boat races upwind and down.

If the apparent wind speed drops, you are either in a lift
or a lull (or a wind shadow or you have changed course). In a
lull the apparent wind angle will initially shift forward. Your
boat speed will drop. If you head up to try to accelerate you
will have to re-trim to the new wind. (This is not the correct
response to a lull in light air, but is correct in moderate winds.)
In a lift, the apparent wind will shift aft. You can hold
your course and bring the pole back—your speed will drop, or
head up to keep the original boat speed and apparent wind—at
a higher compass course. The correct response is neither of
those—the correct response is a jibe!
The spinnaker trimmer and helmsman must pay close at-
tention to find the lifts. It is more difficult than detecting head-
ers upwind, which you can read in the jib and compass, and

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
