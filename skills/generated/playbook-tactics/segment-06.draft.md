# RegattaFlow Playbook Tactics Core Concepts

## Focus
> C HAPTER 2: R ACE PREPARATION

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

2.1 Introduction
Many races are won or lost before they even start.
As boats head for the line some are ready to race and oth-
ers are not. In this chapter we will look at things to do during
the hour prior the start to get ready to race. Longer term prepa-
ration of the boat, crew, and equipment is covered in the com-
panion text, RegattaFlow Playbook. Racing Trim.
Every sailboat race is really several events in one. To suc-
ceed, you must understand the weather, harness the wind, and
battle against opponents. To win, you will need to be ready for
challenges of every type. You’ll also need to figure out which
are the critical variables for today’s race.
2.2 Get Ready to Race
On the Way Out…
Race Day preparation begins with a routine to insure that
everything needed is brought along and anything not needed is
left ashore. Once on board, the time spent getting to the course
area should be used to review any changes in technique or
organization from previous races. New crew should be paired
with regular crew and briefed on responsibilities. The boat
should be rigged and, if conditions permit, sailed to the course
area. Wind checks should be made periodically. Weather condi-
tions and any special strategic situations (season/ series stand-
ings) should be discussed.
