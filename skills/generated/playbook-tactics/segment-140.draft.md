is that if you can figure them out, it will give you a
big strategic advantage.
The Main Idea
Wind shift strategy downwind is like
upwind shift strategy stood on its head.
Instead of sailing the lifted tack, as you do
upwind, the objective is to sail on the headed
tack—allowing you to sail more of a reach,
rather than a run, to the leeward mark. In
oscillating winds this means jibing on the lifts downwind, the
reverse of tacking on the headers upwind. In persistent shifts
this means sailing away from the shift in order to jibe onto the
headed tack later in the leg—the inverse of sailing into the shift
and tacking onto the lifted tack upwind.
So far so good, but there is more. For starters let’s take a
closer look at downwind strategy in oscillating and persistent
shift conditions.
Oscillating Shifts
Oscillating winds are winds which are shifting back and
forth, oscillating like a pendulum. In oscillating conditions
your goal is to sail the headed tack downwind. Once you are
on the headed tack, watch for a lift. When you are lifted, jibe
to sail headed on the new tack. When you are lifted, jibe again
(Fig. 6).
The first step is to get in phase as you round from the
windward leg. The best way to do this is to note the headed
tack as you approach the windward mark, and then get onto
this headed tack at the first opportunity downwind (Fig 7).
Even when you start the leg in phase with the shifts, it is
easy to get out of phase or lose track—wind shifts are difficult
to detect when you are sailing downwind. If all else fails, sail
the jibe which carries you closest to the mark.
Later we’ll discuss techniques for detecting shifts—it can
be tricky.
