infighting, but it is definitely worth it to break away first.
Second, if you are well behind, there is an opportunity for
an heroic end run. Rather than get suckered up by the crowd,
sail low—on or below the rhumb line—while the fleet sails
high. Later in the leg, as the fleet squares away to slow reach-
ing angles and they choke on each other’s bad air, you can
beam reach across the bottom of the leg and pass the crowd.
Your chances for success are enhanced by light air and adverse
current, and the risks are slight (Fig. 31c). I’m proud to men-
tion that I was crewing in the Etchells North Americans one
Autumn when we went from 29th to 8th in one leg with just
such a tactic! (Regrettably, space does not allow me to recount
how we arrived at the jibe mark 29th.)

Heavy Air Tactics
While most of the forgoing tactics apply in all wind condi-
tions, there are some special opportunities in heavy air. Light
to moderate winds result in similar sailing speeds for similar
boats, but speed differences can be pronounced in heavy air.
As the breeze comes on, shift your focus from tactics to perfor-
mance. Get clear and sail fast—the best tactic of all.
Reaching or Running?
Very broad reaches should often be treated as runs. If the
angle is broader than the proper sailing angle then strategically
the leg is not a reach, but a skewed run. Even if the leg doesn’t
initially warrant running tactics, you may need to change
modes if you find yourself well above the rhumb line (Fig. 32).
For more on Running Strategy and Tactics, look no further
than the next chapter.
Final Thoughts on Reaching Tactics
Mixed Fleet Tactics
In a mixed fleet with a broad range of handicaps, the im-
portance of tactics is diminished. You are racing the clock more
than other boats. Boats nearby are obstacles, but they may not
be rivals if they rate differently than you. Negotiate peace and

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
