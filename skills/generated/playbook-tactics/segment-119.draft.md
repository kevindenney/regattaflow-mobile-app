> C HAPTER 9: R EACHING S TRATEGY AND T ACTICS

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

9.1 Introduction
This is not the time to have lunch. It is time to get to work.
Have half your crew eat lunch sitting on the rail going up wind.
Let the other half go hungry. Sailing downwind, we need the
entire crew’s efforts. There is much to do: Trim the spinna-
ker sheet, guy and pole, trim the main, call tactics, look back
for shifts (and the competition, hopefully), find the mark, and
more.
This chapter will cover Reaching Strategy and Tactics. We
will look first at reaching strategy, and then tactics, in a variety
of conditions. We will consider how tactics change with the
type of fleet you are racing in, and where you fit into the crowd.
Running Strategy and Tactics is an entirely different animal,
and has a chapter all its own. Rules for reaching and running
are covered in Chapter 11: Downwind Rules, Mark Roundings
and Finishing.
General Strategy
I’d like to open this section with a couple of revelations:
First, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.
(Until your boat speed approaches the speed of light this will
remain essentially true.) Second, you will not pass anyone until
you are going faster than they are. Add also the corollary: If
you can sail faster than the boats behind you, you’ll never have
to look back (Fig. 1).
Reaching strategy can be built on these two fundamentals:
• Sail the Rhumb Line.
• Sail Fast!
