# RegattaFlow Playbook Tactics Core Concepts

## Focus
> 11. Starting in Bad Air

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Coming off the line in bad air requires a quick evaluation
of options. Can we tack? Can we squeeze up or drive off into
clear air? It can take minutes before things open up and you
have a chance to clear out. If you are unsure what to do, con-
sider your overall strategy. If you want to go right then it may
be worth ducking a few sterns to get out that way. If you are
on the favored tack or if you are headed for the favored side, it
may be worth eating bad air for a short while—though it will
seem an eternity (Fig. 22b).
