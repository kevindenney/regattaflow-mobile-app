everyone, and then blast off while others wallow.
Lufing boats tend to drift to leeward. Fore-reaching
– holding close-hauled trim while sailing above close-hauled
– is an effective way to minimize leeway and create acclera-
tion room to leeward.

Elvstrom Start
This is an approach I observed Paul Elvstrom using in
shifty conditions. He positioned himself to leeward of the
R.C. Boat and luffed on the starboard tack layline. If the
last shift before the start was a lift, he sailed it to start at the
favored boat end of the line; if the last shift was header, he
sailed it to the favored pin end.
Advantages
In shifty conditions, this approach allows a last minute
decision based on the final shift before the gun.
Danger!
Timing is tricky. Be sure to allow enough time to get to
the line in a header—and be sure you will be able to fetch.
The Secret to Success
The beauty is that while the rest of us luffed on the line
and battled to hit the first shift after the start, Elvstrom was a
step ahead, hitting the last shift before the start.
Dip Start
Approaching from the wrong side of the line, find a gap
and dip into it from above.
Advantages
When the line is difficult to approach from below due to
light wind and strong current, you drop into a front row seat.
This approach is useful only when the line is difficult to ap-
proach in the conventional way.
Danger!
The danger of being over early or of being luffed by lee-
ward boats limits the usefulness of this approach. Also illegal
if the One Minute Rule is invoked.
The Secret to Success
The Dip Start can succeed in light air and adverse cur-
rent. A large R.C. boat with the line site near the bow increas-
es the chances of success, as does a pin favored line.
3.4 Conclusion
Starting strategy is a game of choices, requiring a bal-
ance between overall strategic goals, line set, and crowding.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
