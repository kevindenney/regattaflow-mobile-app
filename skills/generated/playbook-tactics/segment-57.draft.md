Sail to the Shift
Coming off the starting line on starboard tack our com-
pass reads 10°. A few minute later it reads 5°, and soon after
that, 0°. With each little header some of our competition tacks
away. Some tacked to port on the first header off the line. Oth-
ers have gradually bailed out as the header continues.
Eventually, with the compass reading 0°, we tack over.
Our course on port tack is 90°. We are short of the layline to
the mark. Gradually we are lifted, first to 85°, then 80°, 75°,
and finally 70°. We are lifted to the mark, far ahead of those
who tacked out early.
When Should We Tack?
The choice of where to tack is a little tricky. Theoretically
we want to tack so we will be lifted exactly to the mark. This
curved lifted layline would give us the full advantage of the
shift without sailing any extra distance. This is a tough call, to
say the least. A more realistic approach is to tack short of the
layline. Then, as you approach the mark, tack out again, and
take another guess. Don’t overstand or you’ll be sailing extra
distance. As you get closer to the mark, you should be able to
make a more accurate layline call.
Another (tactical) perspective on where to tack is to main-
tain position between the fleet and the shift. Don’t sail to the
corner – just get a controlling position.
So Much for the Competition
Coming off the starting line on starboard, we gradually
got headed. Some of the fleet played the header as an oscil-
lating shift, and tacked out. They expected to be headed again
(on port tack) before tacking back to starboard. This was a big
mistake. We knew from our Wind Graph that we were in a
persistent shift. We used persistent shift strategy by sailing into
the header, towards the new wind.
The boats which tacked out early kept getting lifted fur-
ther and further on port tack, which made starboard tack look

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
