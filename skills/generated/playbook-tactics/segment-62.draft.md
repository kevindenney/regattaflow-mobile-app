Other Types of Shifts
As we said above, pure persistent and pure oscillating
wind shifts are quite rare. There are infinite variations.
One variation is a mix of persistent and oscillating shifts.
This mixed condition is characterized by oscillating shifts
gradually shifting one way or the other – veering or backing
– over time.
Several other types of wind shifts occur. One is a major
shift where a new wind completely replaces the existing wind.
This can happen suddenly, or after a period of calm. Winds
vary in other ways. There are geographic shifts caused by the
configuration of land, and thermal wind shifts created by the
heating of land. There are also differences in the wind due to
differences in current (as we will see below), and there are
shifts caused by the movement of weather systems.
Mixed Conditions
In mixed conditions, combining both oscillations and per-
sistent characteristics, the strategy is to sail toward the persis-
tent shift while still playing the embedded oscillations.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
