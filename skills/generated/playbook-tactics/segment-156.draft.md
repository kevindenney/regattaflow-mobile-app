11.1 Introduction
In this chapter we will cover downwind rules, mark
rounding tactics and rules, and finishing tactics and rules.
Right of way can change quickly. A clear understanding of the
rules is needed if you are to receive your due and fulfill your
obligations. Furthermore, many offwind and rounding tactics
involve the rules, so an understanding of the rules is essential
to tactics.
The rules for upwind sailing and upwind mark roundings
are covered in Chapter 8 – Upwind Tactics.
11.2 Downwind Rules
The same-tack rules predominate on reaches. Rules 11
and 12 cover windward/ leeward and overtaking situations.
Rule 15 covers acquiring right of way, Rule 16 addresses alter-
ing course, and Rule 17 covers proper course issues. As we
move from reaches to runs, we must add consideration of op-
posite tacks (Rule 10).
Windward/ Leeward
The leeward boat always has the right of way. Stop Re-
peat: The leeward boat always has the right of way; the wind-
ward boat shall keep clear.
The interaction of windward and leeward boats depends
on how the overlap was established. When a boat is passing to
windward, a leeward boat may change course as she pleases,
constrained only by Rule 16.1, which requires that she give the
other boat room to keep clear. The windward boat must use the
room provided and promptly keep clear (Fig. 1a).
