## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Much of reaching tactics revolves around keeping
clear air. Without clear air there is little chance for
success. The struggle for clear air can tear us away
from our strategy. Much of the tactical discussion
will revolve around how to keep clear air, and how to balance
that effort with our wind and current strategy for the leg. The
battle to preserve clear air tends to push the fleet above the
rhumb line on reaches. The higher course early in the leg, and
lower course later in the leg, makes the second half of the reach
slower than the first half. As the pack compresses later in the
leg, tactical opportunities increase. Careful positioning early in
the leg can bring rewards later on, and careless positioning can
lead to disaster.
Often the first few boats to round are able to hold to the
rhumb line, while the pack sails extra distance in the struggle
to preserve clear air. Consequently, the leaders tend to get away
– leaving the pack behind (Fig. 15).
Passing Other Boats
The most obvious tactical goal on a reach is to pass those
ahead of you; the obvious first step in that tactic is to sail faster
than those ahead. You’ll have a hard time passing them if you
don’t catch them first. Sail fast. (WOW, really?)
Sail fast, but don’t sail high. The easiest way to build
speed is to reach up. But it is also risky. As you sail up, the
boats ahead will reach up too. You will be adding mileage to
the leg without closing in on those ahead; and you will lose to
other boats which sail less distance.
