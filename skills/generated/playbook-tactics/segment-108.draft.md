## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

It is difficult to survive a protest. If you scare someone
and raise their blood pressure when tacking or crossing, they
can protest you and throw you out. The same applies if you get
someone angry.
There are two common ways to get in trouble: Greed
and surprise, both of which can cloud good judgment. Don’t
be greedy (wishing you could cross is not sufficient) and look
ahead to avoid surprises.
Fig. 49 – When on port, don’t expect a
starboard tacker to risk crashing his boat!
Fig. 50 – Rule 10 gives starboard the right of way.
Rule 16.1 requires that if Starboard changes course, she give
Port room to keep clear. Furthermore, under Rule 16.2, if Port
is ducking then Starboard cannot change course in a way that
requires an immediate change of course by Port.
