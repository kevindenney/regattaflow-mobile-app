# RegattaFlow Playbook Tactics Core Concepts

## Focus
> Tactically, if we tack, we have given up these 212’. If

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

we hang on, and keep our 848’ of separation, then we can gain
it all back just as quickly as we lost it... just as quickly as the
wind returns where it was. We could even pull ahead if the
wind goes further right. What will the wind do?
If we tack we will be 212’ plus 2 boat lengths behind. If
we are one tenth of a knot faster, we’ll gain 10 feet per minute.
We could catch up in about 25 minutes, or gain back half the
loss in 12, and be close enough to get the rest on a small shift.
Assuming our rival tacks on the shift, continuing parallel
puts us no further behind – as long as the breeze doesn’t shift
further left. Let’s hang here, and look for a little righty to tack
on, or maybe a big righty. That would help.
Looking back, maybe we shouldn’t have separated so far.
But tacking would have cost us too, about two boat lengths,
and no way to recover those – they are spent.
Fig. 5 - Being unsure of what will happen next, the boat on the
right would most likely keep going, rather than tack on the lift,
and hope the wind would shift right, and erase the loss. The
boat on the left would likely tack to try to consolidate the gain.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
