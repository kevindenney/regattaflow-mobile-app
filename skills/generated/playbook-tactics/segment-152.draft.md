## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

provides clear air, right of way, and
inside position. It also requires a
jibe drop of the spinnaker. Tactical
prowess is achieved through
superior boat handling!

them; and if not then you round behind, just as you would have
from the outside (Fig. 26).
You Can Do It, If You Can
Have I mentioned the role of good boat handling in tacti-
cal success? Tactical ideas are only as good as the boat han-
dling and boat speed they accompany. There is a special thrill
to the teamwork of attacking a rival, and watching their boat-
handling unravel under your team’s attacks.
Inside position and right of way often go hand in hand.
A starboard tack approach into the mark gives you both. The
rounding, from a starboard broad reach to port tack close
hauled, is not as difficult as you might imagine, though it might
be worth practicing once or twice before you try it in competi-
tion. Incidentally, it is surprising how often inside position at
the end of the leg can be traced back to a jibe set or early posi-
tioning to that side early in the leg (Fig. 25).
If you find yourself on the outside of a pack in the later
stages of a run, make a bold move to the inside. There is little
at risk and much to be gained. Even if you can’t pick off the

main; wing the jib, heel to weather,
and sail slightly by the lee for best
speed.
Since the performance cone is
narrow, you can use your wind
shadow to attack boats ahead.
10.5 Jib and Main Racing
If you are racing non-spinnaker, with just jib
and main then tactics change in several ways.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
