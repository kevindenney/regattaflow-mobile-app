## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

As an outside boat, be sure to let the inside boat know if
you have an overlap. By restricting the inside boat to a safe
rounding, you will be able to get a better position around the
mark; on the inside boat’s hip (Fig. 11). If the inside boat
makes a tactical rounding, you will likely end up directly astern
of the inside boat, in bad air, as in Fig. 10.
“Able to Give”
The outside boat must give room if she is able to give
room. A boat establishing a late inside overlap (just prior to 2
boat lengths) may not be entitled to room. If the outside boat
cannot give the room, due to a crowd of boats outside her, for
example, the inside boat is not entitled to it (Fig. 12).
If the inside boat has a long-established overlap, then
she is entitled to room, and the outside boat must plan in
anticipation of giving room. But if the inside boat gets an
overlap at the last moment, it may not be possible to get room
(Rule 18.2e).
How Much Room?
An inside boat is entitled to room to make a safe (concen-
tric) rounding. An inside or clear ahead Right of Way boat can
make a tactical (wide-and-close) rounding (Fig. 9a). As a first
approximation, one boat length of room is not too much; and in
some conditions more room is justified. On the other hand, an
inside boat has taken too much room if another boat manages
to sneak inside. Protest if this happens, but as an outside boat
never let the inside boat touch you. Stay clear and protest, and
you will be safe. Once there is contact, you may be in trouble.
The existence of an overlap is important even if the inside
boat is leading the outside boat. If the inside boat is clear
ahead, she may make a tactical wide-and-close rounding. If the
outside boat has an overlap the inside boat is restricted to a safe
rounding (Fig. 10).

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
