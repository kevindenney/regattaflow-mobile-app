Pre-Race Data
In preparation for our 12:15 start we periodically record
and plot our wind information. Using the close-hauled compass
course on each tack, we are able to calculate the wind direction.
The Wind Graph from our Race Planner shows the following
(Fig. 12):
• An oscillating breeze, shifting back and forth.
• Starboard tack headings ranged from 170° to 185°.
• Port tack headings ranged from 260° to 275°.
• We tack through 90°; from 170° on starboard to 260° on
port, or from 185° to 275°.
• The wind speed is a steady 8 to 9 knots.
Stay in Phase—Tack on the Headers
Coming off the starting line, we are sailing on starboard
with a compass course of 180° to 185°. These are high num-
bers for starboard tack, which means we are lifted. Gradually
our course drops to between 175° and 180°. This is an average
course, neither headed or lifted, and we can sail on either tack.
Soon the crew reports that our course has dropped below
175°. Other boats are showing similar angles. We are headed.
We tack. As we settle on port tack the compass reads 260°–
265°, low numbers which mean we are lifted on port tack. As
the numbers rise, we are getting headed. Remember: Port,
Higher, Header. When our course falls below our average, we
tack again and sail lifted on starboard.
As the plot shows, we continue tacking on the headers in
the oscillating shifts. Gradually we find ourselves to the left of
the middle of the course. We use the time when the wind is at
the average direction to sail on port tack, which returns us to
the middle. We sail on starboard only when lifted above 180°;
we sail on port for any heading between 260° and 270°.
A New High!
Further up the leg, we are sailing lifted on starboard.
Compass readings show a course between 180° and 185°.
Gradually we are lifted to 190°. At this point lights should
flash, bells should ring, and sirens should sound. 190° is be-
yond our range of oscillations. We are lifted higher than ever

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
