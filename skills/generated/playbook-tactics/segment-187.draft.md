likely. Keep the boat organized. Before dark, do your house-
keeping and make sure things are in order. Clear clutter, check
your coils and sail packing, pre-navigate so you know what to
expect. If you need to run your engine to charge the ship’s bat-
teries, it is best to do that during daylight hours too.
Finishing Strategy
Once the last weather change has occurred, distance rac-
ing strategy becomes short course strategy. When a level-rated
rival emerges in the predawn light on the final morning of a
long race, it is exciting to be aboard as adrenaline kicks in and
carries you to the finish.
Two notes of caution: First, don’t start your sprint to the
finish so early that the entire crew collapses before the end;
enforce the watch system until the last watch. Also, remember
that you are racing the clock as well as the boats you can see.
Avoid getting caught up in a feud with one other boat.
Conclusion: Putting it All Together
A winning strategy is only one ingredient to successful
distance racing. Distance racing involves a whole series of
new challenges, from crew organization and provisioning to
night sailing and safety considerations.
There is great satisfaction simply in sailing well and
finishing a long race. There is a greater thrill to take up the
challenge and return victorious.
race, this is not likely to work because “what goes up must
come down” etc. But in a distance race conditions will change;
the height could as easily become an advantage as a burden
(Fig. 5).
Night Strategy
Distance races are often won at night. Become nocturnal.
Sail hard during the day; sail harder at night to overcome the
difficulties of darkness. A watch system which allows longer
sleep during the day and shorter watches at night is preferred.
Three four-hour watches by day, and four three-hour watches
by night works well.
Be conservative. Be ready for the next change. Without
the visual clues available in daylight, sudden changes are more
