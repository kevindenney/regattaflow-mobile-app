## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Often it is hard to tell if you are ahead of or behind an-
other boat, or if you are gaining or losing versus another
boat. Your hand bearing compass can tell you.
To measure your position sight perpendicular to the wind
direction. This is your LEP. Any boat on this line is
even with you. Boats above are ahead, boats below are
behind.
If you are behind another boat you can compare your
bearing to the LEP bearing. This tells you how big a
wind shift you’ll need to catch up (assuming speeds are
equal).
Your hand bearing compass is also great for calling
laylines. Practice to perfect your technique, and beware
deviation between the ships compass and your hand
bearing compass.
(NOTE: A hand bearing compass makes a great gift. Give
one to your skipper or tactician!)
