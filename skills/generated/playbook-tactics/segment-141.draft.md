Persistent Shifts
A persistent shift is a gradual shift in one direction, either
veering consistently clockwise, or backing counterclockwise.
In persistent shifts sail away from the shift downwind rather
than sailing into the shift as you do upwind. By sailing away
from the shift you can jibe to a closer reaching angle. Sailing
toward the shift would leave you in a position more upwind of
the mark, requiring a broader sailing angle to the mark (Fig. 8).
>>ALERT ALERT<< Major Exception: This persistent
shift strategy fails in a building and shifting wind. In that case
it is best to sail to the new wind—wind strength is a more im-
portant factor than wind shifts (Fig 9).
Fig. 8 – In a persistent
shift, sail away from the
shift to get a favorable
reaching angle.
Fig. 9 – In a building
and shifting wind, ignore
the shift strategy above.
Sail toward the shift
— Get More Wind!
Fewer Shifts, Harder to Find
There are a couple of things which make wind shifts more
difficult downwind than upwind. One is that they are more dif-
ficult to detect. There are several techniques for detecting the
shifts, which we discuss more below – I promise.
The second difficulty is that there are fewer shifts down-
wind than upwind.
Whoa! Fewer wind shifts downwind than upwind! We sail
upwind, and turn and sail the other way, and the windshifts turn
off? How can that be? Turn the page, and find out...

Fewer Shifts Downwind!
Imagine, first of all, a Race Committee at anchor
in a 10 knot wind. As they set a course, they record
the wind speed and wind direction and find oscillating
wind shifts every six minutes. With a wind speed of
ten knots, a six-minute interval places the shifts one
mile apart.
You (a very astute tactician) detect a shift three
minutes before the start. How soon after the start will you
hit the first shift? Three minutes, right? Wrong!
You would expect the next shift at the start area three

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
