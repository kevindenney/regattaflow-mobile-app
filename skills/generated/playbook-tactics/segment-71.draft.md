Fig. 22 – When the current is uniform throughout the leg, the
biggest impact is on laylines into the mark. Current can also
skew the course, changing the balance of time on each tack.
When Current is Not Uniform
When the current is not the same across the course area,
then we must seek out the advantage. Differences across the
course can shape our strategy. Unless there are dramatic differ-
ences in wind conditions a current advantage is key to strategic
planning.
Current to one side
Obviously if the current is stronger to one side seek out
that side if it is favorable, and avoid that side if it is adverse. A
favorable current, running against the wind, can set up a pro-
nounced chop. Look for this. Sail into the choppy water and
ride the current upwind. Similarly, smooth water can indicate
wind and current running together. Avoid this area upwind
(Fig. 23).
Fig. 23 – When there is
stronger current to one side,
go to it if favorable, sail away
if adverse. The advantage can
change with the tides.
Current across the course
When the current runs across the course and is stronger in
one part of the leg, you want to take advantage of the change
in sailing wind caused by the current. Sailing bow into the
current, you will be lifted; sailing with the current astern, you
will be headed. For example, in ten knots of wind and one knot
of current the sailing wind is shifted 6°. With one tack lifted
and the other headed, the effect is a 20% advantage in VMG
(Fig. 24).
Predictable, to a Point
Current, whether tidal or river generated, is predictable.
Tide tables and current charts should be studied, and their
predictions compared with observation. When the current runs
strong it is often more reliable and predictable than the wind; a
small current advantage translates into big gains.

In tidal areas the advantage can be fleeting—or reverse—
over the course of a race. Obviously we need to pay attention

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
