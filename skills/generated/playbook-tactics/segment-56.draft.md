## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

On starboard tack a higher compass reading is a lift, a
lower number is a header. On port lower is a lift, higher is a
header. It is most important to recognize headers since they
suggest it is time to tack. Use the phrase Port, Higher, Header
as an aid to remember the correlation between compass read-
ings and shifts.
Get in Phase
By collecting wind information before the race and updat-
ing information as the race progresses, we should know at any
moment whether we are sailing a lifted, headed, or average
course. If conditions change, our lifted and headed numbers
will have to be adjusted.
Out of Phase
Sailing in oscillations seems pretty straightforward. If the
shifts come in a regular cycle and no one gets in your way, it
should be easy to stay in phase. Somehow it doesn’t always
work that way. If you find yourself out of phase, sail the tack
which takes you closest to the mark, or towards the next puff,
while you sort things out.
Unbalanced Legs
Tacking as the wind crosses the average works great if the
wind spends equal time on each side of average and the mark
is straight upwind. This is not always the case. When the leg
or shifts are not balanced, then the crossover angle for tacking
must be adjusted to match. For example, if the leg is skewed to
three times as much starboard as port, then we’ll need to sail on
starboard for three quarters of the wind range, and port for one
quarter.
Similarly, if there are other strategic considerations, our
tacking angles may be skewed. For example, if there is better
wind or current to one side of the course, we would sail toward
the favored side during average winds, and sail away from that
side only at the extreme end of the shift spectrum.
Fig. 9 – In a persistent shift
we sail toward the shift. Fig. 10 – In oscillating
winds we do the same thing
over and over, always sailing
toward the next shift.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
