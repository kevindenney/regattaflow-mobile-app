## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Fig. 6 – Moments later the grey boat has achieved
an overlap, and the black and white boats have
lost theirs. The mark-room rights are unchanged:
No room for grey, room for black and white.
Fig. 7a – Since the inside boat does
not have an overlap earlier, he must
show that he achieved an overlap on
time.
Fig. 7b – Here the inside boat has an
overlap, and the outside boat claims to
have broken it. So the burden falls to the
outside boat to show that it was broken.
The Three Hull Length Zone
When approaching a mark with company, the question is
whether the boats were overlapped before reaching the zone
– which is three hull lengths from the mark. Any boat over-
lapped to the inside is entitled to room (Fig. 5).
Late Breaks & Overlaps
If an inside boat establishes an overlap after the outside
boat reaches the three length zone, she is not entitled to room.
The overlap must exist before the lead boat hits the zone.
Similarly, if an inside boat has an overlap at the zone, she is
entitled to room even if the overlap is broken a moment later
(Rule 18.2b). To repeat: Room requirements are established
when the lead boat reaches the zone. Anything which happens
after that time is of no consequence (Fig. 6).
Approaching the Zone
The situation prior to reaching the zone is determinative
if there is a dispute (Rule 18.2d). A skipper claiming to have
established or broken an overlap just before reaching the zone
must established his claim beyond reasonable doubt if protest-
ed (Fig. 7a&b).
Therefore, though no hail is required, it is good practice
as you approach the zone to establish the situation—overlap or
no. Don’t wait until you’re in the zone to open communica-
tions.

Fig. 8 – The inside boat asks the outside boat if there is an
overlap. The outside boat hails, “3 lengths, no overlap, no
room.” Accepting this, the inside boat turns to go outside,
and hits. Well, what do you know – there must have been

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
