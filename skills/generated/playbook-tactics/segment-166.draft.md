## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

tack is more nearly parallel to the line and starboard more
nearly perpendicular, then the port end of the line is favored; as
you pass under the port end you would be sailing extra distance
parallel to the line, and vice versa. (See Figs. 20 and 21.)
Upwind Finishing Rules
The rules at an upwind finish are like those at an upwind
mark rounding. Starboard/port prevails, and a windward boat
may call for room if overlapped at the three length zone. You
are not required to cross a finish line. Once any part of the boat
or equipment crosses the line you may clear yourself in any
direction, provided you do not interfere with those still racing
(Fig. 22).
Finishing Tactics Downwind
Finishing tactics downwind focus on the favored end, just
as they do upwind. We want to sail proper reaching angles and
finish at the favored (upwind) end (Fig. 23).

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
