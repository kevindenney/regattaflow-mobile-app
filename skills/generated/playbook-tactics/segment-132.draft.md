eral routes cover most circumstances.
Most often the preferred route is to come in wide and go
out close. In wide and out close is preferred because it gives
you control and clear air as you start the next leg. To do this
you’ll need to start your turn early—two or more lengths from

inside position, limiting your maneuverability and taking your
air.
