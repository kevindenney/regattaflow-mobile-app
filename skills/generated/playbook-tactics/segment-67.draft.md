## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Generally the upper wind will become dominant. Funda-
mental wind strategy says sail toward the new wind—in this
case sail toward the upper wind, as it will eventually displace
the surface wind. If the upper wind is from the right, go right.
Here’s a trick if you are a small boat in a mixed fleet: Look at
the mastheads of larger boats. Sometimes you will be able to
find a wind shear (and a clue to the expected wind) which does
not show at your masthead (Fig. 17).
Don’t confuse wind shear with wind gradient. Wind gra-
dient is the tendency for winds at the mast head to be stronger
than those at deck level. It exists almost all the time, and is
more dramatic in light air, less pronounced in heavy air.

Fig. 17 – Wind shear is the
stacking of two winds, one on
top of the other. The upper wind
usually displaces the lower wind.

7.5 The Impact of Wind Shifts
It is often difficult to predict the wind. Is it worth it to try
to figure out what the wind is going to do next? How much dif-
ference does it make?
The Impact of Persistent Shifts
We’ll assume here a course set to the wind at the start,
with incremental shifts to the right. For the initial segments
boats make equal progress upwind. Then the wind shifts 5° to
the right.
The boat on port tack, going right, is headed. The tacti-
cian struggles with his own convictions, and resists the tide
of sentiment to tack on the header. Meanwhile the boats on
starboard are lifted up toward the mark – Yippee!
They sail on.
Another shift, further right. Finally, the tactician going
right calls for a tack. Now they are lifted on starboard – higher
than any lift they’d seen before the start.
The boats going left are in a quandary. They are lifted,
but the wind is going right. The black boat bites the bullet, and
tacks. It is very hard to tack when you are lifted – if you don’t

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
