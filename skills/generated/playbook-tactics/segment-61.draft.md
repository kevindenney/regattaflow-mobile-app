# RegattaFlow Playbook Tactics Core Concepts

## Focus
> strategy. What is causing this new reading? Helmsman error?

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Changing weather? Are we closer to shore? Are there any new
clouds? What is going on with the rest of the fleet?
Is this a momentary aberration, after which we will return
to earlier conditions? Or is this the beginning of a persistent
shift? Perhaps the wind will continue to oscillate, but over a
new range or wider range.
The key is to first recognize that something new is hap-
pening. The next step is to evaluate the change and make plans
accordingly. Ideally we would have seen it coming—either
from wind on the water, an expected shift near shore, or by
observing other boats (in an earlier class—we are leading our
fleet, remember).
The Impact of Shifts – Don’t Miss ’Em
Meanwhile, one of our competitors has sailed off the line
on starboard tack and continued one third of the way up the leg
before tacking. From there he sailed across the course on port
tack, to the starboard tack layline. Ignoring the shifts has left
our rival out of phase and sailing headed half the time. On the
other hand, he has only had to tack twice! On a two mile beat
with 10° oscillations, a boat which sails in phase will be min-
utes ahead of a boat which ignores the shifts. That’s even after
we throw in the cost of a couple of extra tacks!
A little later, we’ll pull out our slide rules and find out just
how big a deal wind shifts are, but for now, just remember:
Track the shifts, and hit ’em!

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
