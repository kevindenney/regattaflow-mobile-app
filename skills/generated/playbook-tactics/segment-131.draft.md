## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Fig. 24 a&b - On outside reaches clear air is to
the outside—you must protect both sides. On inside
reaches clear air and mark-room are on same
side—which you must double protect. Fig. 25 - On an outside reach the trailing boat can
fake an attack, and then dive inside for room.
Room Please!
As the leader in that position, it is often best to hold
course—don’t get suckered up. There are also times, as the
leader, when you may actually want to slow down to solidify
the attackers overlap on the outside, and prevent him from div-
ing inside as you square away! Obviously any slowing loses
you distance to the rest of the fleet, but not as much as you
stand to lose if the trailing boat gets mark-room and passes you
at the rounding (Fig. 26).
