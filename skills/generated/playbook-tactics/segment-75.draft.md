course is favored and head that way. Back here it is hard to sail
the middle; all that gets you is traffic and bad air. You must
pick a side. Do it carefully – you can’t afford another mistake.
If you are not sure which way to go (maybe that’s how you
landed in the Land of Opportunity), look to the leaders for
guidance. The leaders are probably doing what is right – hint:
they’re in the lead. Others will gamble against the odds in
hopes of passing the leaders. Our goal is pass the gamblers.
Sail Clean, Fast, Smart
On the reaches, you can save distance by sailing the
rhumb line while letting others waste distance sailing high and
then low. Avoid luffing duels, plan well ahead for the inside
position at roundings and, above all, keep sailing fast.
Running legs offer an opportunity to attack those ahead.
For all you need to know about Running Strategy and Tactics,
skip ahead a few chapters. There are real opportunities here.
The Promised Land
Hopefully you’ve fallen behind early, so you have plenty
of time to catch up. Play the shifts and work the favored side;
and keep sailing fast. Position yourself carefully to pick up a
few boats at each mark rounding. Look ahead for changing
conditions and be ready to respond.
Sometimes, late in a race you may need to gamble, split
with the fleet, and hope to get lucky. But don’t panic if you fall
behind early. Don’t count on luck. Get to work.
Every boat you pass is worth a point, and it is easier to
move from 15th to 5th than it is from 5th to first. When you
find yourself in The Land of Opportunity, keep cool, sail fast,
go the right way, and avoid confrontations. You can reach The
Promised Land. The End (Fig. 28).
Fig. 28 – When you fall behind (as on the previous page) get to
work. With grit, determination, and a little luck, you can reach
The Promised Land.
