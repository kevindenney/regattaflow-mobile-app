## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Scenario 4 - …if and only if the overlap was established from
astern then after the starting signal a leeward boat may NOT
sail above close hauled to close out a windward boat...
Scenario 6 - When a leeward boat changes course she must
leave the windward boat room to keep clear. Rule 16.1.

Scenario 5 - …but if (with the overlap was established from
astern ) the leeward boat's turn to close hauled leaves no room
for the windward boat the windward boat is NOT entitled to
room.
Scenario 7 - When the starting mark is not surrounded by
navigable water, then Rule 19 - Room to Pass An Obstruction
applies and the inside boat gets room.

As mentioned above, the starboard/port, overtaking, and
tacking-too-close rules apply during starts just as they do on
the course. In starboard/port (Rule 10) situations the starboard
boat may do as she pleases, constrained only by the need to
leave port a way to keep clear (Rule 16, Fig. 4b).
The starting rules are intended to bring order to a crowded
starting line. They are fairly effective, at least for upwind starts.
Offwind starts create a whole new set of tactical concerns and
rules dilemmas, as we will see in the next chapter.
5.3 Other Starting Rules
If you hit a starting mark you may exonerate yourself by
doing an immediate One-Turn Penalty (Rule 31, Fig. 3a ).
A boat which is over early must restart by returning to the
proper side of the line (Definition of Start). The Race Commit-
tee must fly code flag X (white field with blue "+") if a boat
or boats is over early (Rule 29.1) but is not required to hail
individual boats — you must judge for yourself whether or not
you have started properly. . While returning to restart, you must
stay clear of those who have started properly (Rule 21.1, Fig.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
