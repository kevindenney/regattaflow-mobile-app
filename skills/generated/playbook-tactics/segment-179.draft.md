App 2.1 Mixed Fleet Racing
The Strategic Imbalance
The type of fleet you race in will effect your tactics. One-
design or level-rated competition is more tactical. Your clos-
est rivals are the boats nearby. In racing with a wide spread of
handicaps, your closest rival may not be within reach. In fact,
with some scoring systems the final handicaps aren’t figured
out until after the race when conditions are entered.
Handicap racing is strategic. You race the clock, not
boats. Stay clear of other boats and get around the course fast.
The only exception is approaching the finish near a level-rated
competitor. In that situation, you must balance the tactical con-
cerns for finishing in front of the rival with the overall strategy
of beating the clock in a mixed handicap fleet.
Small Fry & Big Fish
When racing a relatively small boat in a mixed fleet, there
is a tendency to get pushed to the side in search of clear air, as
the larger boats take up the center. The smaller boats must pay
