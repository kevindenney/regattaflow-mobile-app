The Initial Segment: Positioning for Freedom
The priorities during the first part of any beat are to keep

the first shift and get to work on strategy. If the goal is to work
to the right, it may be necessary to tack shortly after rounding
and then tack back when a clear lane to the right is available.
If you are outside at the rounding, you may be able to reach
through for clear air and save two tacks (Fig. 22).
If the strategy is to go left, then you must work to be free
to tack after the rounding. Beware the wind shadow and tur-
