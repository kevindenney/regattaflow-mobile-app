# RegattaFlow Playbook Tactics Core Concepts

## Focus
> 1. Learning to see the wind:

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Sure, good sunglasses help, but there’s no magic beyond
paying attention. Here’s what to look for:
See the wind on the water – dark patches are puffs.
But which way will it shift?
You may be able to see how it is moving – but that is tough.
Your experience with the previous puffs is your best guide.
Some days they are all right shifts, some days the puffs
oscillate, some times it seems random.
Another guide is other boats. See what is going on there.
Finally, don’t let sun sparkle and cloud shadows trick you.
On a clear day the sun sparkle makes the sunny side look
windy, and on partly cloudy days cloud shadows can look
like puffs.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
