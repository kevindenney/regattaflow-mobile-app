## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Negotiate Early. Do not wait until the three boat length
zone to start negotiations, especially at a crowded rounding.
Tell all boats nearby what you expect, and be sure to warn
potential vultures against forcing their way through. Appoint
a spokesman to handle inter-boat dialogue. While one crew
member negotiates your rights, the rest of the crew should keep
sailing (Fig. 17).
Room or Starboard? At starboard roundings and star-
board gates, inside port tack boats are entitled to mark-room
once they reach the zone (Fig. 18).
Many places (and races) are won and lost at the corners.
To win you must position yourself carefully, negotiate diplo-
matically, and handle your boat smoothly.
Fig. 18 – Downwind inside the three boat
length zone mark-room takes precedence
over starboard/port.
Fig. 17 – Negotiate Early: Don’t wait
for the three boat length zone to start
your negotiations.
Fig. 15 – Watch for Vultures: When you
are giving room, be sure to hail those
not entitled to room to keep them from
trying to force their way in.
Fig. 16 – While giving room, these outside
boats are late entering the 3 boat length
zone. By the time they enter the grey boat
has an overlap and is entitled to room.

11.4 Finishing Rules & Tactics
Finishing Tactics depend on what kind of race you are in.
In one design or level-rated racing, your goal is to finish ahead
of as many boats as possible; finishing tactics are then similar
to positioning tactics approaching a mark. In handicap rac-
ing, the goal is to finish as soon as possible; in this case avoid
boat-on-boat duels and sprint to the finish. There are times in
handicap races when a level-rated competitor is close at hand
and both situations apply simultaneously.
Finishing Tactics Upwind
You should shoot the finish by turning up into irons and
coasting the last boat length or two. By shooting you are able
to shorten the distance sailed while coasting at nearly full speed
(Fig. 19).
A finish line has a favored end, much like a starting line.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
