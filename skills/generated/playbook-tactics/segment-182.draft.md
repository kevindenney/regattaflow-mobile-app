On a 35 foot boat, in 10 knots of wind, bearing off 10°
from close hauled will increase speed from about 6 knots to 6.6
knots. By sailing 1.5% further you go 10% faster! Heading up
10° from a broad reach creates the same result. A 20° change
of course adds less than 7% extra distance! Sail Fast (Fig. 3).
App 2.3 Distance Racing Strategy
Success in distance racing is more than a simple exten-
sion of round-the-buoys technique. Strategy involves a bigger
picture of weather changes over a period of days. Crew orga-
nization includes setting a watch system to take advantage of
your crew’s skills. Motivation changes as you are often racing
against the clock, out of sight of your nearest rivals. Concerns
about safety, provisioning, and health demand added atten-
tion. The basic principles of success around the buoys remain
intact—sail fast, go the right direction—but achieving these
objectives becomes a more involved process.
There are six basic elements to distance racing strategy.
They start with the fundamental approach of sailing to the fin-
ish. To that we will add strategies for sailing fast, planning for
weather, and boat-for-boat positioning. We will also look at
special strategies for catching up from behind and night sailing.
Sail Toward the Finish
Draw a line from the start to the finish. Follow that line.
This may not sound like a real breakthrough, but more races
are won with this strategy than any other. Use this strategy as
your starting point, and modify from there. When in doubt, re-
turn to this approach (but not to the original line): Draw a new
rhumb line from your present position, and follow it.
Sail Fast
Sail fast means more than sailing our best, straight up the
rhumb line. Usually we can sail substantially faster by sailing
a few degrees off the rhumb line. The goal is to get as close
to the finish line as fast as we can. Sailing straight down the
rhumb line may not do it.
By sailing up (or down) 10° off the rhumb line, we may

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
