practice and achieve our strategic goals. Broadly speaking,
there are two general categories: Those that allow us to control
and influence others, and those which allow us to prevent oth-
ers from doing the same to us.
As we look at tactical weapons, we will discuss what each
does and how it is used.
Controlling other Boats
Tight Cover
A tight cover is a an aggressive move which slows an ad-
versary by putting the him in your wind shadow. A tight cover
necessitates a response. Use a tight cover when you want to
force another boat away (Fig. 32).
To put it another way: You should tack and cover only if
it would be time to tack anyhow, even if the other boat weren’t
there. You use a tight cover when you want to go the way they
were going, and want to force them to go the way you were go-
ing, which suggests that maybe you were going the wrong way
to begin with...
Tack so you are directly upwind after accelerating or the
rival may escape your shadow (Fig. 33).
Loose Cover
A loose cover is a course parallel to the opponent(s) which
does not put the other boat(s) in our wind shadow. A loose
cover is more defensive than a tight cover. A loose cover does
not impede the progress of the other boat(s). It puts you in a
position where you can protect your lead (Fig. 34).
Your intent with a loose cover is to deny your opponent
the opportunity to sail different conditions than you are sailing.
A tight cover, on the other hand, often forces your opponent to
tack away. The danger with a tight cover is that your opponent
then separates from you, and may find more favorable condi-
tions.
