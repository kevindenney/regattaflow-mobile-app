the relative distance as you pass abeam of the other
end. This offers only a rough measurement.
No matter which technique (or combination) you use, you
must recheck the line if the wind shifts. The first technique is
preferred because it allows you to quickly recalculate after a
wind shift. It also allows you to determine how many degrees
off square the line is set, and the magnitude of the advantage,
as we shall see.
Fig. 6 - You can determine the favored end by observing
other starts. If the fl eet comes off the line bow to bow, the
right is favored; bow to stern, then the left is favored.
Right-Favored
Left-Favored
Fig. 7 - You need not start on port tack to take advantage of a
left end favored line. You will realize the advantage when you
tack.
Q2. How Much Difference Does It Make?
Two boats starting from opposite ends of a square line
will be equally far from an upwind mark. If they were on
converging tacks, they would hit bow to bow. If the line is
not square to the wind, then one will start ahead, as shown in
Figure 3.
You don't need to start on port tack to take advantage of
a pin-favored line. You will realize the advantage when you
tack to port (Fig. 7).
How Far Ahead?
For a line 5 degrees off square (most are), the advantage
is 12.5% of the distance between the boats. If the line is 10
degrees off square (not uncommon), the advantage is 25% of
the distance between the boats.

Fig. 8 - For a line that is 10° off square, the advantage
at the favored end is 25% of the length of the line—
That's 5 boat lengths on a line 20 lengths long!
Fig. 9 - The position of the windward mark does not determine
the favored end of the line. The set of the line relative to the
wind, not the mark, determines the favored end.
The position of the mark may be a factor in our first leg

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
