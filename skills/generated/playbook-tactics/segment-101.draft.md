Herding
Herding is any technique which encourages other boats to
go the same way you are going. Hmm. Why would you want to
do that? And how would you do it?
You herd other boats along when you are fearful of what
may happen if they get away. If you are uncertain of what the
wind shifts will do, you want to stay near others to minimize
your risk.
There are two basic ways to herd another boat. The first
uses a series of tight covers on one tack and loose covers on
the other tack. This encourages the opponent to sail the loosely
covered tack (Fig. 36). The second is with a pin, which is de-
scribed below.
Pin
A pin is a tack into position on another boat’s hip which
prevents the opponent from tacking away. It is used approach-
ing a layline, where you can prevent your opponent from tack-
ing to the mark until you do. It is also useful when herding one
boat back toward a pack you want to cover (Fig. 37).
When you are unsure of what to expect next with the
wind, a loose cover lets you sail near your opponent.
Go Ahead and Cover
If you are ready to tack but delay for a moment, you can
dump bad air on an opponent close behind. This frustrates the
opponent, as he must now tack away or sail in bad air. Given
the chance, you can be sure he will return the favor.
The assumption is that you would be tacking anyhow, for
strategic reasons, and take the opportunity to force the rival to
sail the wrong way.
The Sucker Cover
You are crossing a close rival and tack on his air. You

## Conversion Checklist
