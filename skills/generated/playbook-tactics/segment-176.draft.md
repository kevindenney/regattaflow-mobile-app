App. 1.4 Mark-Room and Other Rules
Rule 18 covers Mark Room. Portions can be quite com-
plex and the language confusing to the point where you can
lose track of the major points. Here are the essentials:
When boats are overlapped, the inside boats gets room.
When boats are overlapped when the first of them reaches
the three boat length zone, the inside boats gets room even if
the overlap is later broken (Fig. 9).
When boats are NOT overlapped when the first of them
reaches the three boat length zone, the clear ahead boats gets
room even if an overlap is later established (Fig. 9).
Rule 18 does NOT apply between boats on opposite tacks
at a windward mark. The regular Port/ Starboard rule applies
(Fig. 10).
Mark-Room is covered in more detail in Chapter 8: Up-
wind Tactics and Chapter 11: Downwind Rules, Mark Round-
ings and Finishing.
A Few Other Rules
While the Right-of-Way Rules which govern situations
when boats meet, get most of the attention, there are other rules
you need to know.
There are Fundamental Rules in Part 1 of the Rule Book
which address safety, fairness, and responsibility, and the rules
of Part 3, which detail how races are run. There are rules on
scoring, and on the conduct of protest hearings, and special
rules for match racing and team racing.
Rule 44 explains the Penalties for Breaking Rules. Usu-
ally if you interfere with another boat then you must do a Two
Turns Penalty. If you hit a mark, a one turn penalty is required.
(Fig. 11).
One of my favorite parts of the Rule Book is Appendix H
which explains the procedures for weighing wet clothing.
We won’t rewrite the rule book here. Get one and read up.
The best time is early April, before sailing season, when you
should be doing your taxes.
Fig. 9 – Check owes room to Black and
White, but not to Grey. Mark-Room is
set by overlaps at the 3 length zone.
Later changes do not matter.
