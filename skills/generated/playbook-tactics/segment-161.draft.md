## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

an overlap.
Fig. 9a – An inside windward boat
is only entitled to room to sail to
the mark, not a tactical wide-and-
close rounding.
Fig. 9b – The outside boat
should make a tactical turn to
end up behind, not outside, the
inside boat.
So go ahead, put the burden of sportsmanship on him.
You can trust those you race against to be fair and honest.
Of course, if sportsmanship fails, you can always fall back
on the rule of law. When the outside boat hails…
Three boat lengths, no overlap, no room!
…you turn smartly to the outside to stay clear. If you hit,
then you have proof through performance that there was an
overlap. If it comes to a protest you will need to establish that
both boats were traveling at the same speed on parallel courses,
and that you made an immediate turn when hailed (Fig. 8).
And if you don’t hit—well, then I guess you didn’t have
an overlap after all. But chances are your rival has been so
preoccupied with the mark-room call that his rounding will be
a mess, and you will pass him in short order regardless.
A Gentleman’s Sport
Given the occasional differences of opinion about the ex-
act position of the three boat length zone, prior discussion can
be critical. As an inside boat you should ask the outside boat to
call the overlap and the three boat length zone. Put the burden
on the outside boat. Is it too much to expect an honest appraisal
from our rival? “Do let us know if we’ve got an overlap at the
zone, won’t you?”
It certainly is easier for the lead boat to call the situation.
From the helm, he can more easily judge an overlap at his stern
and your bow than you can from your helm. And he is also in
a better position to call when his bow reaches the three boat
length zone. You, after all, may still be nearly five lengths
from the mark when his bow reaches the zone.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
