## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Race Strategy will effect starting strategy, as we shall see.
The Set of the Line refers to the angle of the line to the wind.
In Making It Work we will look at balancing race strategy,
line set, and other concerns.
First Leg Strategy
Race Strategy for the first leg is the first factor to con-
sider in deciding where on the line to start.
If strategic considerations suggest sailing up the right
hand side of the beat, then a start at the right end of the line
is preferred. By starting at the right end we are free to tack
and go right immediately after starting. Clear air is relatively
unimportant, as we will be tacking away. Freedom to tack
and go right is the first priority.
No favored end

Fig. 2 - Simply put, start right to go right, start left to go left,
and start in the middle to keep your options open.

Fig. 4 - To fi nd the favored end, compare the compass course
of the line to the wind direction. If the line is 90° from the
wind then the line is square. If the wind is less than 90° from
the line you are headed toward the favored end; greater than
90° and you are sailing away from the favored end.
end. Once you know the bearing of the line, you can
update your calculations as the wind changes. For
example, in the illustration, the line is set at 320°. If
the wind direction were 230° the line would be square
to the wind. With the wind at 240° the right end is
10° favored. With the wind at 220° the left end is 10°
favored (Fig. 4).

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
