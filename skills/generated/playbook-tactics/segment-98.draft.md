## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Fig. 30 – Tack short of the layline if the layline
is crowded. Clear air and a small shift could
put you ahead.
Fig. 29 – A port tacker can lee bow a
starboard boat on the layline, or cross
and use the starboard boat as a blocker.

just below the layline, bail out. You
cannot pinch in bad air.
tacker is not prepared or fails to execute properly, then he will
not be able to prevent a reversal (Fig. 28)
If the port-tack boat sails to the starboard tack layline, then
the starboard tacker (now coming in on port) may be able to lee
bow and lead to the mark. If the port tacker tacks short of the
layline, then we have a reversal of our earlier situation. Go back
one paragraph. Do not round the mark. Do not collect $200.
On the Laylines
On the layline, a lee bow position is preferred; just don’t
fail to fetch the mark.
If the starboard tacker is on the layline, a port tacker can
tack ahead, or on the lee bow, to round ahead of the starboard
tacker. If there is doubt about whether or not the starboard
tacker will fetch, it is best to cross and tack to weather, using
the starboard tacker as a blocker against those coming into the
layline later (Fig. 29).
If there is a crowd on the layline, tack away and come back
later, rather than sail extra distance or in bad air at the layline.
Once you go to the layline and duck the crowd, you concede (for
that leg). By tacking out, you give yourself one more chance—at
the risk of losing others if the layline fills (Fig. 30).
Bail Out Early
You’re on the layline. Almost. Just a little shy of the
layline maybe, but you can pinch up and make it. Maybe. Stop
kidding yourself and bail out now.
If you bail out early, there may still be room on the layline
to get back in line. If you wait until later to flop to port, it may

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
