Sequence 3 Sequence 2 Sequence 1
Fig. 2 - Luffi ng at Starts
Sequence 1: Before the gun L may luff as she
pleases – provided she gives W room to keep clear.
Since L established her overlap from astern, she must as-
sume proper course at the gun.
Sequence 2: L may luff as high as she likes – provided she
gives W room to keep clear – before and after the gun.
Sequence 3: After tacking into the overlap, L may luff as high
as she likes – provided she gives W room to keep clear.
Sequence 4: As in Sequence 1, after the gun, L is restricted
to proper course – but in this case proper course means
pinching up to start.

Scenario 1 – A leeward boat sailing close-hauled may close out
a windward / inside boat at the start..
5.2 Barging
A leeward boat need not give an inside boat room when
approaching the line to start, as the Mark Room rules do not
apply (Section C Preamble).. (An inside boat is entitled to
room when the fleet is noodling around before the start.)
The windward / leeward rule (Rule 11) applies. It is con-
strained only by the need to leave room for the windward boat
to keep clear (Rule 16).
If the overlap was established from clear astern, then
the leeward boat is further restricted to not sail above proper
course after the starting signal (Rule 17). (By definition there
is no proper course prior to the starting signal.)
If L's turn to proper course creates room for W to start (as
in Scenario. 4, at right) that is W's good fortune; but if L's turn
to proper course leaves no room for W then W is NOT entitled
to room (see Scenario 5)
The anti-barging rule is detailed in the situations presented
on this and the facing page.

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
