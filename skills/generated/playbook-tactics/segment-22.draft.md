is important to maintain at least half speed throughout the
approach. Another trick to knowing when to "pull the trig-
ger" and accelerate to full speed. Truth is, time, speed, and
distance judgement is the secret to success in most starts, not
just this approach.
In big fleets there is rarely sufficient room to be fully ac-
celerated at the gun. The key is to hold a position with clear
air in the front row. Boats tend to push to the line early to
keep clear air. While you might prefer to hang back to leave
room to accelerate, you have to stay in the front row to keep
clear air.
The Half Speed Approach shares the basic out-and-back
geometry of the Vanderbilt Start (coming up next), but has
some distinct advantages.
Half Speed Approach
The Half Speed Approach is popular and effective. Sail
away from a spot on the line and turn back early to allow for
the congestion and bad air of the fleet. Once headed for the
line, speed is adjusted to properly time the approach. The ob-
ject is to approach at half speed with final trim coming early
enough to reach full speed and hit the line at the gun.
Advantages
The half speed approach is relatively simple and reli-
able–a good choice in moderate to heavy air. It gets you set
up early and puts you in the front row. This approach is effec-
tive in any part of the line. For a right-hand end start, you can
bottle up the crowd reaching in above you.
Danger!
Tacking kills speed. Jibing carries you away from the
line. Allow plenty of time for your turn. At the same time,
beware setting up too close to the line, without room to accel-
erate. Also, avoid this approach in light air, or in a heavy boat
which is slow to build speed.
