it does not determine the favored end of the line. The favored
end is a function of wind direction—not mark position.
On a typical starting line, 20 boat lengths long, and 10°
off square, the advantage from end to end is 5 boat lengths!
A 5 length lead off the line is no small matter—clearly the
set of the line is an important factor in our decision where to
start (Fig. 8).
Mark Position and Favored End Not Related
Not so clear is the fact that the position of the windward
mark does not determine the favored end of the line. Boats
starting at the upwind end will be in the lead, and will be able
to cross boats starting from the downwind end and lead them
to the mark. Even though the downwind end may be closer
as the crow flies, it will be further in upwind sailing distance
(Fig. 9).

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
