## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Get Blockers To Protect You
You’re on port, and you’re getting ready to tack. You look
over your shoulder and see a crowd on your hip. You need a
blocker (a boat ahead and to leeward) to shield you from the
crowd (Fig. 19). A blocker will take all the heat (lee bows etc.)
as you sail into the crowd. A boat you can just cross makes an
excellent blocker. After you cross, sail two lengths and tack.
Now your blocker will lead you through. Anyone who can
cross the blocker can cross you. Boats which might normally
create a problem for you run into the blocker first. You sail on
without interference.
Hidden boat trick!
Watch for this: Two starboard-tack boats are approaching
a port-tack boat. The leeward starboard boat waves the port
tacker by, “Go ahead.” Imagine the port tack boat’s surprise
when he sees another starboard tacker previously hidden from
view! (Fig. 20).
ward. If the leg is a port fetch, try to avoid a clearing tack to
starboard when you round the leeward mark. On a starboard
fetch, try to tack immediately at the mark.
From the ahead and to leeward position, you have greater
control and better opportunities in wind shifts. If you are lifted
you may fetch; and if you are headed, you will be able to tack
and cross those on your hip.
If you sail the short leg first, then you will quickly find
yourself in the corner with few options (Fig. 17).
More Tactical Ideas
Anticipate
When you’re on port tack, sailing on the hip of another
port-tack boat, plan how you will react if he tacks. Will you
tack or duck? Your response depends on a number of tactical
and strategic factors. Don’t wait for the other boat to tack to de-
cide your response (Fig. 18).

blocker. Cross him and tack. Others will have
to deal with him fi rst, leaving you free.
