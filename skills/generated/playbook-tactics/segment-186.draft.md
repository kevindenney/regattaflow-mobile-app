## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

If you are behind, there are a couple of options to con-
sider. One is to simply follow the competition and drag them
down from behind with superior speed. Over a long haul a
little speed advantage adds up—don’t be impatient.
The other option is to sail fast regardless of the angle.
Your goal should be to reach to a position abeam of the com-
petition—translate your distance behind into height. In a short
Fig. 4 - Weather Strategy: The basic idea is, Sail to the new
wind. The danger is sailing the forecast, when it may not come
true. Sail the wind you’ve got until you are confident in the
forecast; then go to the new wind.
In the Annapolis to Newport Race several years ago a cold
front came off the New England coast the second night out.
Boats which had worked to a position inshore were able close
reach in the new wind, while boats offshore had to sail hard on
the wind.
