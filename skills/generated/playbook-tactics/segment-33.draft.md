## Focus
> 9. Start Near a Marshmallow

## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Another useful technique is to find a “marshmallow”
to set up nearby ( Fig.12). If you can surround yourself with
slow boats, you will be assured of less interference coming off
the line. (Kinda’ makes you wonder about all those times you
found yourself near the fleet champion at starts last season,
don’t it?)
Fig. 11a - To defend your space from a port-tack poacher,
rotate your boat across your space with your sails luffi ng.
Fig. 11b - When a starboard tack shark attacks, lure him in
above you, or let him pass, and then head up sharply.
Fig. 12 - Start near a marshmallow.
