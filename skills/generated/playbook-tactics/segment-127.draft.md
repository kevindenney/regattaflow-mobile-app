## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Fig. 16 - To pass another boat, you must fi rst sail faster than
them, and then make one decisive move to get by.
Fig. 17 - Get into the Passing Lane on close reaches by sailing
with a jib briefl y before setting your spinnaker.
Behave. Don’t sail high. Catch your rival by sailing faster
without sailing higher. Sail right up his transom, or aim at the
leeward quarter. This non-threatening approach will save you
from sailing extra distance, and it may lull the rival into com-
placency.
Look for an edge and make your move. Once you
are close astern, look for an opportunity to pounce on your
opponent’s air. You’ll need a puff, or a wave to give you a
performance edge. Or use the element of surprise when the
other crew is not paying attention. Pounce when they are pass-
ing around drinks, or removing excess clothing, or the guy is
cleated, or the main unattended (Fig. 16).
Set, Ready, Go.
You have to pounce. Ready, Set, Go takes too long. You
must be set to go at any time. Head up quickly. Trim the sheets.
Ease the guy. Hike out. Practice your pounce so everyone
knows the move. You will succeed if your crew pounces effec-
tively, and the other crew fails to respond properly.
The Passing Lane—Does it Exist?
There is a Passing Lane on close reaches. On a shy spin-
naker reach you can set up in the passing lane at the outset, by
jib reaching to a position where boats with spinnakers can’t get
up to your line. As we discussed in Chapter 2: Race Prepara-
tion earlier in this book, sailing the course in miniature before
the start will help you anticipate how tight the reaching legs
will be (Fig. 17).
Not only does the Passing Lane exist; the Get Passed
Lane exists too, and there may be times you want to get into it,
as we shall see, below.
