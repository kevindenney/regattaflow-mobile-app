## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

Fig. 2 – Downwind Performance can be divided into three
sectors: Light air—up to 10 knots, moderate air—10 to 14
knots, and heavy air—15 knots and above.
a – In light air, optimum performance is achieved at a high
(and consistent) reaching angle about 40° above dead
downwind.
b – In moderate air, the optimum angle changes dramatically
with the wind speed.
c – In heavy air, we can sail straight to the mark.
10 knots of wind to 165° in 14 knots of wind. Boat speeds do
increase slightly, but it is the ability to carry speed at lower and
lower angles which characterizes the moderate wind segment
of the performance spectrum (Fig. 2b).
Off in the puffs, up in the lulls is very much a part of mod-
erate air running.
Heavy Air Performance
In winds of 15 knots or greater, we can sail almost directly
downwind—or straight to the mark. The preferred sailing angle
is influenced by waves along with strategic and tactical consid-
erations (Fig. 2c).
10.2 Downwind Performance
With this understanding of downwind performance, we
can now look at downwind strategy and tactics. Obviously,
these performance parameters will dictate changes in strategy
for each segment of the performance spectrum.
Two additional comments: These wind speeds and angles
are fairly consistent for keelboats (sailing with spinnakers). For
more details, see RegattaFlow Playbook Racing Trim. Also, for wind speeds
under 3 knots, best performance is a mystery. I suggest you
keep your head down, use a smooth back swing, and follow
through toward the green. Good luck! 	180

Fig. 3a,b – If the advantage upwind was due to wind, then the
same side will be favored downwind. If the advantage upwind
was current driven, then the opposite side will be favored
downwind.
10.3 Running Strategy
As always, strategic variables are wind, wind shifts, and cur-

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
