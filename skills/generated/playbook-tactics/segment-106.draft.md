## Source Highlights (auto-extracted)

fill the old foe is safely behind, in your wind shadow, unnerved,
confused, and sailing badly (Fig. 48a).
Or #2: He may cross. No, he can’t. He decides to duck,
no, tack. Yes, duck. He pulls the helm up under his chin, but
the boat hardly responds. The jib sheet is thrown off. “I thought
you said tack.” After a nervous moment the rudder grabs and
the boat pivots down to a broad reach, sailing nearly parallel to
you. Passing under your stern on a reciprocal course, they head
the wrong way, finally coming to course about 2 boat lengths to
leeward. The jib comes in slowly (Fig. 48b).
Or #3: He may cross. No, he can’t. He decides to duck,
no, tack. Yes, duck. He pulls the helm up under his chin, but
the boat hardly responds. The main has not been eased and
the boat won’t bear off. He hits you amidships, just behind the
shrouds, and takes a big chunk out of your port rail. The only
thing bigger than the hole in your rail are their eyes (Fig. 48c).
In order to achieve a reversal, you must duck properly.
Look ahead and be ready to react.

My God” duck, and The Starboard Tack Boat’s Cockpit.	Fig. 47 – With a good duck, when you tack the
next time you will be on starboard—and ahead!
build speed when you bear off, but don’t wait until you have
passed to trim up again. Repeat: faster than close-hauled and
trimmed all the way as you pass under his stern. You get a lift
from the air off his sails. Pinch up in it and work to weather. If
you’re lucky, you’ll even be able to surf out on his stern wave
(Fig. 46).
You sail fast, and eventually you tack. Your opponent
tacks too. You come together; only this time you’re on star-
board. You give him a wave. Theoretically he will cross you by
the margin of your duck. Too close to call. Not only that, but

## Conversion Checklist
- [ ] Translate the highlights into teachable tactical guidance
- [ ] Add practical on-water scenarios/examples
- [ ] Include quantifiable decision triggers (angles, speeds, timing)
- [ ] Define pre-race checks and in-race callouts
- [ ] Update frontmatter description before publishing
