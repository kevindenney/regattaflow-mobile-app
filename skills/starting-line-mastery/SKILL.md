# Starting Line Mastery

## Description
Execute championship-level starts by mastering line bias analysis, strategic positioning, tactical approach, speed control, and space defense. This skill combines strategic planning with tactical execution to consistently win the start.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Line Bias Determination
Identify the favored end of the starting line using four proven methods:

**Method 1: Luff into Irons**
- Position boat at line center or one end
- Luff head-to-wind until stopped
- Observe which end appears further forward
- The end that's further forward is favored

**Method 2: Reach Along the Line**
- Sail close-hauled past one end
- Note compass bearing to opposite end
- Compare to wind direction
- Calculate bias angle

**Method 3: Sight from One End**
- Position at one end looking down the line
- Use hand bearing compass
- Check angle relative to wind direction
- Quantify bias in degrees

**Method 4: Close-Hauled Observation**
- Sail close-hauled parallel to line
- Note if you're pointing at, above, or below line
- If pointing above: windward end favored
- If pointing below: leeward end favored

**Decision Trigger**: A bias >5° makes the favored end worth fighting for. At <5° bias, prioritize strategic wind advantages over line bias.

### 2. Strategic Starting Position

**Left Side Start When:**
- Persistent left shift expected
- Better pressure on left side of course
- Left side leads to favorable current/geography
- Starboard tack preferred off the line

**Right Side Start When:**
- Right shift or right side pressure expected
- Need to get right immediately
- Pin end heavily favored (>10° bias)
- Port tack getaway available

**Middle Start When:**
- Uncertain conditions
- Oscillating winds
- Want to keep options open
- Mid-line bias or square line

**Tactical Guidance**: In big fleets (>30 boats), avoid extreme ends unless heavily favored (>10° bias). Middle positioning preserves options and reduces risk of getting buried.

### 3. Tactical Information Gathering

**Pre-Start Intelligence:**
1. **Line Length (timed)**: Sail the line at race speed, time the transit
2. **Laylines**: Identify laylines to each end for positioning reference
3. **Line Sights**: Establish transit markers for each end (buildings, landmarks)
4. **Committee Boat Position**: Note any bias from RC positioning
5. **Current Set**: Check for cross-line current affecting approach

**Timing Callouts:**
- 5 minutes: Final strategic decision on where to start
- 3 minutes: Enter the starting area, establish position
- 2 minutes: Begin final approach sequence
- 1 minute: Accelerate to full speed or set up for speed control
- 30 seconds: Commit to final position
- 10 seconds: Full acceleration phase

### 4. Speed Control Techniques

**To Slow Down:**
- **Luff jib first**, keep main trimmed
- Creates weather helm
- Holds bow up, preserves leeward space
- Alternative: Oversteer (turn through wind while controlling sails)

**To Accelerate:**
- **Drive off by trimming jib first**, then trim main
- Generates immediate power
- Clears backwind from leeward boats
- Can achieve "faster than close-hauled" speed with good spacing

**Speed Ladder (from slow to fast):**
1. Head to wind, sails luffing (stopped)
2. Jib luffing, main trimmed (slow, controllable)
3. Both sails luffing partially (medium slow)
4. Close-hauled (full speed)
5. Close-hauled after bearing off (faster than full speed - requires 2+ boat lengths space)

**Decision Trigger**: With <1 boat length spacing, start at full close-hauled speed. With 2+ boat lengths spacing, you can use the "bear off and trim up" technique to start faster than close-hauled.

### 5. Space Defense

**Create Space by:**
1. **Squeeze up** to compress space to windward
2. **Drive off** to create leeward acceleration room
3. **Luff neighbor to windward** (before 2-minute rule)
4. **Hold position** with slight luff once space established

**Defend Space Against:**
- **Lee bow attempts**: Keep bow up, don't let them establish overlap
- **Windward squeeze**: Claim space early, before they get close
- **Late chargers**: Hold your lane, don't get pushed around
- **Bargers at RC end**: Stay inside the layline, force them to go around

**Tactical Weapons:**
- **Pre-start luffing** (before 2-min): Establish psychological dominance
- **Mast abeam position** (after 2-min): Protect your leeward position
- **Weather helm parking**: Control speed while holding weather position
- **Starboard approach**: Ultimate right-of-way for final 30 seconds

### 6. Final Approach Execution

**Port Tack Approach (most common):**
- Approach on port from behind the line
- Tack to starboard for final run
- **Tack timing formula**: Tack with (distance to line in seconds ÷ 2) remaining
  - Example: 60 seconds from line → tack with 30 seconds to go
- Allows speed build-up and position adjustment
- Provides starboard right-of-way protection

**Starboard Tack Approach:**
- Approach from below the line on starboard
- Requires precise timing (no slowing allowed)
- High risk if early (barging/over early)
- High reward if timed perfectly (starboard rights, momentum)

**Dip Start (advanced):**
- Approach on starboard parallel to line
- Dip below line and accelerate back up
- Used when crowded or uncertain timing
- Sacrifices distance but ensures legal start

**Vanderbilt Start (conservative):**
- Start from leeward position with clear air
- Sacrifice initial distance for speed and freedom
- Tack away immediately after start
- Effective in shifty conditions

### 7. Getting Off the Line

**First 60 Seconds Critical:**
- **Primary goal**: Clear air
- **Secondary goal**: Tactical position relative to strategy

**Clear Air Hierarchy:**
1. Full speed, clear air on lifted tack = ideal
2. Full speed, clear air on headed tack = acceptable, tack soon
3. Slow speed, clear air = accelerate then evaluate
4. Any speed, bad air = escape immediately (tack or duck)

**Escape Options:**
- **Tack immediately**: If you have room and it fits strategy
- **Duck and drive**: If lee-bowed or backwinded
- **Pinch and squeeze**: If you have lane to consolidate
- **Bail to sides**: If buried mid-line

**Decision Trigger**: If you're not at full speed within 30 seconds of the start, you're in trouble. Execute escape plan immediately.

### 8. Common Pitfalls and Recovery

**Problem: Over Early**
- **Recovery**: Return immediately, re-cross cleanly
- **Minimize loss**: Re-cross at favored end if possible
- **Avoid**: Don't drag other boats over with you

**Problem: Late/Second Row Start**
- **Recovery**: Don't compound error by starting in bad air
- **Better option**: Delay further, start with clear air 5 seconds late
- **Restart**: Consider another approach if >10 seconds late

**Problem: Squeezed at RC End (barging)**
- **Prevention**: Stay inside layline by 1 boat length
- **If trapped**: Shoot head-to-wind or dive below pack
- **Never**: Don't force a barging situation, you'll be DSQ

**Problem: Lee-Bowed on Line**
- **Prevention**: Defend leeward space aggressively before 1-minute
- **If it happens**: Pinch above their wind shadow or tack immediately
- **Last resort**: Duck their stern, restart with clear air

**Problem: Buried Mid-Line**
- **Prevention**: Start near the side you want to go (left/middle/right)
- **If trapped**: Sail through first clear lane even if not strategic
- **Recovery**: Get clear air, then work back to strategic side

### 9. Key Metrics and Benchmarks

**Timing Precision:**
- Elite: Within 2 seconds of gun, full speed
- Advanced: Within 5 seconds, 95% speed
- Intermediate: Within 8 seconds, 90% speed
- Beginner: Legal start with clear air (time penalty acceptable)

**Position Success Rate:**
