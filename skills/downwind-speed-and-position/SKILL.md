# Downwind Speed & Position

## Description
Master reaching and running strategy through optimal VMG angles, puff/lull management, wind hunting, jibing strategy, and tactical positioning. Maximize downwind performance across all conditions from light air to heavy weather.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Reaching Strategy Fundamentals

**Two Core Principles:**
1. **Sail the Rhumb Line**: Shortest distance between two points
2. **Sail Fast**: You won't pass anyone until going faster than they are

**The Rhumb Line Concept:**
- Direct line from mark to mark
- Minimize distance sailed
- Deviations should have clear speed/tactical benefit
- Return to rhumb line quickly after excursions

**When to Deviate:**
- Chasing significant pressure (2+ knots difference)
- Avoiding bad air from boats ahead
- Responding to major wind shifts
- Tactical positioning at jibe mark

**When to Stay on Rhumb:**
- Marginal pressure differences (<1 knot)
- Clear air available
- Stable wind conditions
- Leading and protecting

**Decision Trigger**: Only deviate from rhumb line if:
- Expected gain >2 boat lengths per minute of deviation
- OR tactical necessity (avoiding blanket zone)
- AND can return to rhumb line without loss

### 2. Puff and Lull Management

**Reaching in Oscillating Conditions:**

**Bear Off in Puffs:**
- As puff hits, bear off to build boat speed
- Sail below rhumb line during puff
- Increases apparent wind, maximizes speed
- Banking angle/distance for later

**Head Up in Lulls:**
- As wind lightens, head up toward rhumb line
- Maintains apparent wind strength
- Preserves boat speed
- Returns to rhumb line

**Key Phrase**: "Off in puffs, up in lulls"

**Common Mistake to Avoid:**
- Most sailors do opposite: up in puffs, down in lulls
- This feels fast but leaves you high of rhumb line
- Forces slow, low sailing later in leg
- Net result: slower overall

**Decision Trigger**:
```
IF puff strength increases >1 knot → Bear off 5-10°
IF lull drops speed >0.5 knots → Head up 5-10°
IF already below rhumb line → Stay low even in lulls
IF already above rhumb line → Stay high even in puffs
```

### 3. Building and Fading Breeze

**Building Breeze Strategy:**

**Concept**: Think of building breeze as one long lull followed by one long puff

**Execution:**
- Go up (toward weather) in current light wind
- Aggressively sail toward new wind
- Bear off when new pressure arrives
- Sail low with the increased wind

**Benefit**: Arrive in new wind before competitors
**Be Bold**: Gains can be 10+ boat lengths

**Decision Trigger**: When velocity forecast shows +3 knots building, commit to reaching high early. Spend first 1/3 of leg sailing 10-15° high of rhumb line.

**Fading Breeze Strategy:**

**Concept**: Existing wind is relative puff - reverse the building breeze approach

**Execution:**
- Sail low (below rhumb) while wind is strong
- Bank distance in current pressure
- Head up as wind fades
- Preserves apparent wind as true wind drops

**Challenge**: Tactical pressure to stay high (boats behind will try to sail over)
**Defense**: Hold clear air while sailing low - worth the fight

**Benefit**: Gives real boost when reaching up in lighter air
**Additional advantage**: Pushes apparent wind forward (harder to steal)

**Decision Trigger**: When velocity forecast shows -3 knots fading, commit to sailing low early. Spend first 1/3 of leg 10-15° below rhumb line.

### 4. Wind Shifts on Reaches

**Oscillating Wind Shifts:**
- Shifts aft (lift) = apparent wind decreases
- Shifts forward (header) = apparent wind increases
- **Response**: Head up in lifts, bear off in headers (opposite of upwind!)
- **Goal**: Maintain apparent wind strength and boat speed

**Persistent Shifts:**
- Monitor if mark bearing changes
- If shift makes mark more reachable: sail high early
- If shift makes mark less reachable: sail low to compensate
- Adjust course gradually, not dramatically

**Decision Framework:**
```
IF wind shifts aft (lift) → Head up to maintain apparent wind
IF wind shifts forward (header) → Bear off slightly
IF persistent shift making mark harder to reach → Sail low early
IF persistent shift making mark easier to reach → Sail high initially
```

### 5. Tactical Reaching

**Clear Air Priority:**
- Clear air > perfect angle every time
- A boat sailing 5° off-angle with clear air beats optimal angle with bad air
- Protect your wind aggressively

**Position Hierarchy (best to worst):**
1. **To weather with clear air**: Control position, can defend
2. **To leeward with clear air**: Speed advantage, vulnerable to blanket
3. **Dead astern with clear air**: Difficult to pass, but safe
4. **Any position with bad air**: Emergency - escape immediately

**Establishing Weather Position:**
- Come out of windward mark with height advantage
- Defend high lane in first 1/3 of leg
- Force leeward boats to sail low
- Maintain pressure through sail trim

**Leeward Position Defense:**
- Build speed immediately
- Sail low early to prevent blanket
- If boat comes over top, jibe away early
- Don't wait to get buried

**Decision Trigger**:
```
IF boat threatens to blanket from weather within 5 lengths → Jibe away
IF you have weather position AND they're trying to drive through → Hold high, force them low
IF mid-leg AND bad air AND not gaining → Jibe to clear air
```

### 6. Jibing Strategy

**When to Jibe on Reaches:**

**Two-Jibe Strategy (most common):**
- Jibe at approximately 1/3 and 2/3 of leg
- Balances tactical options with minimal jibes
- Allows wind hunting between jibes

**One-Jibe Strategy:**
- Single jibe at mid-leg
- Used when: rhumb line sailing, stable conditions
- Minimizes maneuver time loss
- Lower risk

**Multiple-Jibe Strategy:**
- Three or more jibes
- Used when: very puffy, significant pressure hunting
- Tactical positioning critical
- Higher skill requirement

**Jibe Timing Based on Position:**
```
IF leading → One-jibe strategy (minimize risk)
IF mid-pack → Two-jibe strategy (standard)
IF trailing → Multiple jibes (hunt opportunities)
```

**Jibe Mark Approach:**
- Approach on starboard jibe when possible (right of way)
- Jibe to round mark smoothly
- Inside boat has rights (within 3 lengths)
- Plan final jibe to optimize mark rounding

**Decision Trigger**: Jibe when:
- Sailing >15° off rhumb line
- OR reaching layline to mark
- OR tactical necessity (avoiding bad air)
- OR significant pressure difference (>2 knots)

### 7. Running Strategy

**Fundamental Rule**: "You won't pass anyone until going faster"

**VMG Angle Optimization:**
- Too high: sailing more distance
- Too low: sailing slower speed
- Optimal: best velocity made good toward mark
- **Testing**: Try angles 5° each side, measure time to marks/buoys

**Wind Hunting on Runs:**

**Primary Goal**: Find and stay in pressure
**Secondary Goal**: Sail optimal VMG angles

**Pressure Indicators:**
- Darker water (more wind)
- Whitecaps
- Other boats with full sails
- Weather forecasts
- Wind line observations

**Execution:**
- Sail toward visible pressure
- Accept course deviations for +2 knots wind
- Jibe to optimize angle when in new pressure
- Monitor other boats' speed for clues

**Decision Trigger**:
```
IF pressure difference >2 knots AND within 90° arc → Sail to pressure
IF pressure difference >3 knots AND beyond 90° arc → Still worth it
IF pressure difference <1 knot → Stay on rhumb line
```

### 8. Running Tactics

**By-the-Lee vs. Dead Run:**

**By-the-Lee (sailing with wind from leeward quarter):**
- **Advantages**: Better apparent wind, easier to defend
- **Risks**: Accidental jibe
- **When**: Trying to go low, defending leeward position

**Dead Run (wind directly astern):**
- **Advantages**: Simpler, no jibe risk
- **Disadvantages**: Vulnerable to attacks from sides
- **When**: Stable conditions, leading

**Tactical Positioning:**

**Leading:**
- **Strategy**: Stay between fleet and mark
- **Tactics**: Match jibes of threats loosely
- **Positioning**: Slightly to weather of rhumb line
- **Risk**: Don't overdefend (stay within 45° arc)

**Trailing:**
- **Strategy**: Jibe away from leaders
- **Tactics**: Hunt for different wind
- **Positioning**: Accept lateral separation
- **Risk**: Commit to finding advantage

**Covering on Runs:**
- Difficult to cover tightly (they can jibe away)
- Loose cover: stay within 45° arc to mark
- Match major jibes, not every move
- Prioritize your wind over blocking theirs

**Decision Framework:**
```
Position | Tactic           | Jibe Frequency | Risk
---------|-----------------|----------------|------
Leading  | Loose cover     | Minimal        | Low
Top 25%  | Own race        | Moderate       | Medium
Trailing | Split & hunt    | Aggressive     | High
```

### 9. Lull and Puff Management on Runs

**Running is Different from Reaching:**

**On Reaches**: Off in puffs, up in lulls
**On Runs**: More complex - depends on conditions

**Light Air Runs (<8 knots):**
- Head up in puffs to build speed
- Sail lower angles in steady pressure
- **Goal**: Build apparent wind in marginal conditions

**Medium Air Runs (8-15 knots):**
- Standard technique: sail optimal VMG angle
- Minor adjustments in puffs/lulls
- **Goal**: Maintain consistent speed

**Heavy Air Runs (15+ knots):**
- Bear off in puffs to control boat
- Head up slightly in lulls to maintain pressure
- **Goal**: Boat control and safety

**Surfing Conditions:**
- Head up to catch wave
- Bear off down face of wave
- Pump/rock within rules
- **Goal**: Maximize surfing opportunities

**Decision Trigger**:
```
IF <8 knots → Head up in puffs to build speed
IF 8-15 knots → Maintain optimal VMG angle
IF >15 knots → Bear off in puffs for control
IF waves present → Optimize for surfing
```

### 10. Downwind Rules Awareness

**Key Rules for Tactical Positioning:**

**Port/Starboard (Rule 10):**
- Applies on all points of sail, including runs
- Starboard jibe has right of way
- **Tactical use**: Approach jibe mark on starboard

**Windward/Leeward (Rule 11):**
- Windward boat keeps clear
- Leeward boat cannot sail above proper course (after establishing from astern)
- **Tactical use**: Establish leeward position for rights

**Clear Astern/Ahead (Rule 12):**
- Boat clear astern keeps clear
- Only applies to same tack boats
- **Tactical use**: Establish overlap before 3-length zone

**Mark Room (Rule 18):**
- Inside boat entitled to room within 3 lengths
- Must have overlap when reaching zone
- **Critical**: Establish overlap early

**Decision Trigger**: Within 5 boat lengths of mark, prioritize establishing favorable overlaps over optimal speed/angle.

### 11. Fleet Management Downwind

**Large Fleet (30+ boats):**
- Rhumb line sailing preferred
- Minimize jibes (traffic)
- Clear air is critical
- Conservative strategy

**Small Fleet (<15 boats):**
- More freedom to hunt wind
- Tactical jibing viable
- Split from pack if trailing
- Aggressive opportunities

**Mixed Fleet (different boat types):**
- Faster boats: protect clear air, sail fast
- Slower boats: tactical positioning, force errors
- **Know your competition**: adjust tactics to boat type

### 12. Transition Zones

**Top Mark Rounding to Reach:**
- Establish position (high/middle/low) in first 30 seconds
- Build speed before worrying about perfect angle
- Clear air > optimal position initially
- Commit to lane within first 1/4 of leg

**Reach to Run Transition (Jibe Mark):**
- Plan jibe sequence for smooth rounding
- Arrive on starboard if possible
- Inside position valuable (mark room)
- Speed through rounding > perfect approach angle

**Run to Leeward Mark:**
- Set up for weather mark (upwind leg)
- Inside position critical
- Final jibe 5-8 lengths from mark
- Carry speed through rounding

**Decision Trigger**: Begin planning mark approach when 10 boat lengths away. Commit to final approach when 5 lengths from mark.

### 13. Measuring Success

**Speed Benchmarks:**
- Track boat speed in various conditions
- Compare to polar diagrams
- Note optimal VMG angles for your boat
- Build speed database over time

**Position Tracking:**
- Record position at each mark relative to fleet
- Track gain/loss per leg
- Identify patterns (gaining on reaches? losing on runs?)
- Focus improvement on weakness

**Tactical Success:**
- % of legs with clear air throughout
- % of mark roundings in top 1/3 of fleet
- Successful jibes executed (no losses)
- Pressure hunting success rate

**Target Metrics:**
```
Clear air: >90% of downwind legs
Top 1/3 position: >60% of mark roundings
Clean jibes: >95% success rate
Position gain: Net positive on 60%+ of downwind legs
```
