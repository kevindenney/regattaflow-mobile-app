# Current Counterplay Advisor Skill

This Claude Skill creates opponent-specific current plays—lee-bow tactics, foul-tide traps, split protection, and anchoring asymmetry.

- Requires fleet state, tidal intel, and opponent profiles.  
- Produces JSON describing offensive plays, defensive counters, and monitoring checklists.  
- Explicitly quantifies current-driven gains and flags risk/abort conditions.

See `skills/current-counterplay-advisor/SKILL.md` for the detailed prompt.*** End Patch
