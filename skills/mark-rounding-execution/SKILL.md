# Mark Rounding Execution

## Description
Master mark roundings through perfect wide-and-close technique, inside/outside positioning, mark room rules, and tactical execution. Save boat lengths at every mark with proper rounding mechanics and strategic positioning decisions.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. The Wide-and-Close Technique

**Fundamental Principle**: "In wide, out close"

**The Physics:**
- Need ~2 boat length radius to carry speed through turn
- Starting wide allows smooth, fast arc
- Finishing close = optimal position for next leg
- Proper rounding saves 10-30 seconds per mark

**Execution Steps:**

**Approach:**
1. Target entry point 2 boat lengths wide of mark
2. Maintain speed into rounding zone
3. Begin turn smoothly 2-3 lengths before mark

**Mid-Turn:**
4. Maintain steady turning radius (avoid jerky movements)
5. Keep sails powered throughout turn
6. Adjust sheet tension for changing angles

**Exit:**
7. Pass mark within 1 foot if possible
8. Establish course for next leg as you pass mark
9. Build speed immediately after rounding

**Decision Trigger**: If approaching too close (within 1 length), you'll have to brake or turn sharply - both kill speed. Always target 2-length entry spacing.

### 2. Mark Rounding by Type

**Windward Mark (Upwind to Reach/Run):**

**Solo Rounding:**
- Approach on port layline (most common)
- Begin turn 2-3 lengths before mark
- Roll tack to starboard while bearing off
- Set spinnaker during turn
- Exit with speed and clear air lane

**In Traffic:**
- Establish inside overlap before 3-length zone
- Claim mark room loudly: "Room at the mark!"
- Inside boat controls rounding speed
- Outside boat must give room for seamanlike rounding

**Common Errors:**
- Overstanding layline (sailing extra distance)
- Turning too early (must round mark closely)
- Turning too late (collision risk or penalty)

**Leeward Mark (Run/Reach to Upwind):**

**Solo Rounding:**
- Approach from downwind
- Drop/douse spinnaker before turn (or during)
- Begin turn 2-3 lengths before mark
- Wide entry, tight exit on close-hauled course
- Carry reaching speed into close-hauled

**In Traffic:**
- Inside position extremely valuable (first to weather)
- Outside boats often forced wide
- Establish overlap early (before 3-length zone)
- Time spinnaker drop to avoid interference

**Value**: Proper leeward mark rounding can save 30-60 seconds (carrying speed to close-hauled)

**Jibe Mark (Reach to Reach or Run):**

**Solo Rounding:**
- Plan jibe to round smoothly
- Approach on starboard jibe when possible
- Jibe during turn or just before
- Wide-and-close still applies
- Maintain speed throughout

**In Traffic:**
- Starboard jibe has right-of-way approaching mark
- Inside overlap critical
- Coordinate jibe timing with turn
- Avoid backing up boats behind you

**Decision Matrix:**
```
Mark Type    | Entry Width | Exit Distance | Speed Priority
-------------|-------------|---------------|----------------
Windward     | 2 lengths   | <1 foot       | Medium-High
Leeward      | 2 lengths   | <6 inches     | Highest
Jibe         | 1.5 lengths | <1 foot       | High
Finish       | Variable    | N/A           | Medium
```

### 3. Inside vs. Outside Position

**Inside Position Advantages:**
- Right to mark room (within 3 lengths)
- Can control rounding speed
- First to weather after leeward mark
- Protected position

**Inside Position Disadvantages:**
- Must round mark (can't overshoot)
- Limited options if wind shifts
- Responsible for clean rounding
- Can be forced wide by outside boats if no overlap

**Outside Position Advantages:**
- More freedom to adjust
- Can sail optimal angles
- Less pressure from rules
- Can often pass inside boat after rounding with better exit

**Outside Position Disadvantages:**
- Must give mark room if inside overlap exists
- Often forced wide
- Second to weather after leeward marks
- Vulnerable to multiple inside boats

**Strategic Decision:**
```
IF leading → Outside can be good (freedom, less traffic)
IF mid-pack → Inside preferred (protection, mark room)
IF trailing → Inside critical (only way to gain positions)
IF solo rounding → Position irrelevant (execute perfect wide-and-close)
```

**Decision Trigger**: Commit to inside or outside position when 5-8 boat lengths from mark. Don't change after 4 lengths (causes chaos and penalties).

### 4. Mark Room Rules (Rule 18)

**The Three-Length Zone:**
- Zone = 3 hull lengths from mark
- Overlap status at zone entry determines mark room rights
- **Inside overlap at zone** = entitled to mark room
- **No overlap at zone** = no mark room rights

**Mark Room Definition:**
- Space to sail to the mark
- Space for seamanlike rounding
- Includes space to jibe/tack if required by course

**Key Rule Applications:**

**Rule 18.2a (Mark Room):**
- If overlapped when first boat reaches zone, inside boat gets room
- Outside boat must give room for seamanlike rounding
- **Seamanlike** = 2 boat length radius for most boats

**Rule 18.2b (Exoneration):**
- Inside boat exonerated if forced to break rules while using mark room
- Example: Forced into outside boat while rounding

**Rule 18.2c (Not Overlapped):**
- If clear astern at zone, must keep clear
- Cannot establish inside overlap and claim mark room
- Exception: If enough room to round between leader and mark

**Common Disputes:**
```
Scenario                          | Inside Rights?  | Why
----------------------------------|----------------|------------------
Overlap at zone entry             | YES            | Rule 18.2a
Overlap after zone entry          | NO             | Too late
Clear astern at zone              | NO             | Rule 18.2c
Pushed outside by inside boat     | PROTEST        | Inside exceeded room
Inside hits mark                  | PENALTY        | 360° turns required
```

**Decision Trigger**: When approaching mark in traffic, establish final position by 4 lengths out. Call overlap status clearly and early: "Overlap!" or "No overlap!"

### 5. Tactical Rounding: Leading

**When Leading (Top 3):**

**Primary Goal**: Protect lead, maintain control

**Windward Mark Strategy:**
- Approach on lifted tack when possible (better angle)
- Avoid extreme laylines (trapped if wind shifts)
- Round with clear air lane for next leg
- Don't let boats inside unless strategically beneficial

**Leeward Mark Strategy:**
- Establish inside overlap early (before zone)
- Control rounding speed
- Exit with clear air and freedom to tack
- Force outside boats wide

**General Principles:**
- **Conservative**: Don't take unnecessary risks
- **Controlled**: Maintain clear air and optimal position
- **Awareness**: Know where threats are positioned

**Decision Framework:**
```
IF leading by >100 feet → Round cleanly, prioritize speed over position
IF leading by 50-100 feet → Defend inside when possible
IF leading by <50 feet → Must defend inside aggressively
```

### 6. Tactical Rounding: Trailing

**When Trailing (Bottom 50%):**

**Primary Goal**: Gain positions at mark

**Windward Mark Strategy:**
- Fight for inside position aggressively
- Accept risks to establish overlap before zone
- Plan approach to arrive at zone with inside overlap
- Duck early if no inside opportunity (avoid backup)

**Leeward Mark Strategy:**
- Inside position critical (huge gains possible)
- Establish overlap 5+ lengths before zone
- Force outside boats to give room
- Exit with height and clear air

**High-Risk Tactics:**
- Late luffing to establish inside
- Diving below rhumb line for inside
- Aggressive overlap establishment
- Risk: Penalties, but reward: 3-5 position gain

**Decision Framework:**
```
IF >5 positions back → Take 70% risk for inside position
IF >10 positions back → Take 90% risk for inside position
IF in last 10% of fleet → All-or-nothing inside attempts acceptable
```

**Decision Trigger**: When trailing, commit to inside position attempt by 8 lengths from mark. If attempt fails by 5 lengths, bail out cleanly and set up for outside rounding.

### 7. Traffic Management

**Heavy Traffic Situations (10+ boats):**

**Approaching Mark:**
- Identify clear lanes 10+ lengths out
- Commit to lane by 6-8 lengths
- Avoid changing lanes inside 5 lengths
- Call position early and often

**In the Scrum:**
- Protect your rights (mark room if entitled)
- Respect others' rights (give room when required)
- Communicate clearly: "Inside!", "Room!", "Starboard!"
- Prepare for contact (fend off, don't protest unless egregious)

**After Rounding:**
- Get clear air immediately (priority #1)
- Accelerate away from traffic
- Establish lane before worrying about optimal tactics
- Let chaos sort itself behind you

**Decision Priorities in Traffic:**
```
1. Avoid collision (safety)
2. Establish legal position (no penalties)
3. Secure inside overlap (if viable)
4. Execute clean rounding (speed preservation)
5. Exit with clear air (next leg setup)
```

**Light Traffic Situations (3-5 boats):**
- More freedom to optimize
- Can take wider entry for better speed
- Focus on perfect execution over positioning
- Think two moves ahead (rounding + next leg)

### 8. Layline Approach (Windward Mark)

**The Layline Concept:**
- Imaginary line from mark on close-hauled course
- Arriving on layline = can fetch mark without tacking
- Overstanding = sailing past layline (extra distance)
- Understanding = can't fetch mark (must tack again)

**Optimal Approach:**
- Approach on port tack layline (most common)
- Tack to starboard 2-3 lengths before mark
- Allows speed build-up before rounding
- Provides right-of-way on starboard

**Layline Errors:**

**Overstanding (sailing past layline):**
- **Cost**: Extra distance sailed
- **Caused by**: Conservative approach, wind shift, current
- **Fix**: Recognize early, tack before reaching mark

**Understanding (can't fetch):**
- **Cost**: Extra tack required
- **Caused by**: Aggressive approach, wind shift, current
- **Fix**: Quick tack, but often lose positions

**Calculating Layline:**
1. Observe close-hauled angle on approach tack
2. Estimate 2-boat-length turn radius
3. Add safety margin (5-10° or 1 boat length)
4. Tack when angle to mark matches close-hauled + safety

**Decision Trigger**:
```
IF uncertain about layline → Slight overstand (1 length) acceptable
IF certain about layline → Tack exactly at layline
IF in traffic → Overstand 1-2 lengths (room for traffic)
IF solo → Tack on exact layline
```

**Wind Shift Adjustment:**
- Lift after tacking = overstand (unavoidable, accept it)
- Header after tacking = understand (tack again immediately)

### 9. Finish Line Tactics

**Finish Line Bias:**
- Same principles as starting line
- Favored end = finish there
- **Bias determination**: Which end is closer upwind?

**Approaching Finish:**

**When Leading:**
- Identify favored end early (5+ minutes before finish)
- Sail conservative course to favored end
- Don't let boats inside or lee-bow you at finish
- Cover threats loosely

**When Trailing:**
- Must use favored end if biased >5°
- Split from leaders if they're going wrong end
- Accept risks for better finish position

**Finish Line Rules:**

**Same as starting line rules apply:**
- Must cross line completely
- Both ends of boat must cross
- Can approach from either direction
- Mark room at pin end if overlapped

**Tactical Finish:**
- Approach on starboard tack when possible (right-of-way)
- If finish upwind, approach below layline then head up (speed advantage)
- Time final approach to cross at full speed
- In match race: cross ahead and tack on opponent

**Decision Trigger**:
```
IF finish line bias >5° → Sail to favored end (worth 1-3 positions)
IF finish line bias <5° → Sail fastest course (ignore bias)
IF covering opponent → Match their end choice
IF time-on-distance scoring → Favored end critical
```

### 10. Common Rounding Mistakes and Recovery

**Mistake #1: Approaching Too Close (No Wide Entry)**
- **Symptom**: Have to brake or turn sharply
- **Cost**: 5-10 seconds of speed loss
- **Recovery**: Next mark, target 2-length entry
- **Practice**: Wide-and-close drill solo

**Mistake #2: Overstanding Windward Mark**
- **Symptom**: Can fetch mark easily with room to spare
- **Cost**: Extra distance sailed (10-30 feet)
- **Recovery**: Tack earlier next time, improve layline calculation
- **Practice**: Layline recognition drills

**Mistake #3: Missing Inside Overlap**
- **Symptom**: Arrive at zone 6 inches behind leader
- **Cost**: Forced outside, lose 1-3 positions
- **Recovery**: Establish overlap earlier (5+ lengths before zone)
- **Practice**: Aggressive overlap establishment drills

**Mistake #4: Hitting the Mark**
- **Symptom**: Contact with mark
- **Penalty**: Immediate 360° turns required
- **Recovery**: Execute turns promptly, minimize loss
- **Prevention**: Better wide-and-close execution

**Mistake #5: Leeward Mark Too Tight**
- **Symptom**: Can't carry speed through turn
- **Cost**: 10-20 seconds to rebuild speed
- **Recovery**: Next mark, wider entry (2 lengths)
- **Practice**: Speed-preserving rounding drills

**Learning Framework:**
```
After each race, review mark roundings:
- Which roundings gained positions?
- Which roundings lost positions?
- What was different about successful roundings?
- Practice specific weakness before next race
```

### 11. Advanced Rounding Techniques

**The Roll Tack Rounding:**
- Used at windward mark when tacking around
- Roll boat through tack to accelerate
- Coordinate with crew for smooth execution
- Legal within rules (not excessive)
- **Gain**: 0.5-1 boat length over standard tack

**The Inside Fake:**
- Appear to go inside, then bail to outside
- Confuses competitors
- Opens up inside lane (they moved to block)
- High risk if committed
- **Use**: When inside is crowded

**The Late Luff:**
- Luff hard just before zone to establish inside
- Forces outside boat to slow/give room
- Legal if done before zone
- Aggressive move
- **Use**: When trailing and need inside

**The Offset Approach:**
- Approach at angle to mark (not directly)
- Allows wider entry naturally
- Better speed preservation
- More room to maneuver
- **Use**: Solo roundings for optimal speed

### 12. Measuring Rounding Success

**Time-Based Metrics:**
- Time from 3-length zone to full speed on next leg
- Target: <15 seconds for windward mark
- Target: <20 seconds for leeward mark
- Track and improve over time

**Position-Based Metrics:**
- Positions gained/lost per rounding
- Track across multiple races
- Target: Net neutral or positive
- Elite: Average +0.5 positions per rounding

**Technique Metrics:**
- % of roundings with proper wide-and-close
- % of roundings without mark touches
- % of inside overlaps successfully established
- Target: >90% clean execution

**Speed Preservation:**
- Speed at mark vs. speed 3 lengths after
- Target: <10% speed loss
- Elite: <5% speed loss
- Track with GPS or coaching

### 13. Practice Drills

**Solo Rounding Drill:**
