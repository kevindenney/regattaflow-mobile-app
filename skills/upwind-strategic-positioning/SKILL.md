# Upwind Strategic Positioning

## Description
Master upwind strategy through wind pattern recognition, ladder theory application, side selection decision-making, and risk-managed course positioning. Navigate oscillating, persistent, and mixed wind conditions with confidence using compass work, shift prediction, and strategic testing.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Wind Pattern Recognition

**Oscillating Winds (most common):**
- **Characteristics**: Wind direction shifts back and forth around mean
- **Pattern**: Regular 5-15 minute cycles, ±5-15° range
- **Compass signature**: Alternating lifts and headers on same tack
- **Strategy**: Tack on headers, stay in phase with oscillations
- **Key phrase**: "Sail toward the next shift"

**Persistent Shift:**
- **Characteristics**: Wind gradually moves in one direction
- **Pattern**: Continuous trend over 20+ minutes
- **Compass signature**: Steady increase or decrease in heading
- **Strategy**: Favor the side the wind is shifting toward
- **Key phrase**: "New high, stay high" or "New low, sail low"

**Mixed Conditions:**
- **Characteristics**: Oscillations + persistent trend
- **Pattern**: Shifts cycle around a moving average
- **Compass signature**: Range shifts over time (e.g., 170-185° becomes 175-190°)
- **Strategy**: Combine oscillating tactics with persistent bias
- **Key phrase**: "Stay in phase but favor the persistent side"

**Decision Trigger**: After 3+ data points showing same trend, treat as persistent shift. After 2+ complete cycles, treat as oscillating. Until pattern clear, play middle and gather data.

### 2. Ladder Theory and Shift Mathematics

**The Upwind Ladder Concept:**
- Imagine boats on rungs of a ladder angled toward the mark
- When wind shifts, the ladder rotates
- Boats closer to the shift move up rungs
- Boats farther from shift move down rungs

**Quantifiable Gains/Losses (10° shift):**
- **Boats on same tack, split laterally:**
  - Gain/loss = 25% of lateral separation
  - Example: 100 yards apart = 25 yards gained/lost
  - At 6 knots: 848 feet separation (1 minute of sailing) = 212 feet gain/loss (21 seconds)

- **One boat ahead, one behind:**
  - Boat with leverage equal to distance behind: ±19% with shift, ±16% against shift
  - Boat straight downwind (no leverage): +2% gain (slight)
  - To pull even: Need 5.7× leverage relative to distance behind

**Risk/Reward Formula:**
- Splitting tacks for 60 seconds creates 20+ second gain/loss potential in 10° shift
- Risk = 1/3 of separation time for typical shifts (10°)
- Greater shifts = greater risk and reward

**Decision Trigger**: When separated by 100+ yards, a 10° shift creates 25+ yard differential. Consider this when deciding whether to split or cover.

### 3. Compass Work and Data Collection

**Pre-Race Wind Graphing:**
1. Record close-hauled compass heading on both tacks
2. Plot headings over time (5-10 minute intervals)
3. Calculate wind direction: (Starboard heading + Port heading) ÷ 2
4. Identify range, average, and pattern

**Example Oscillating Data:**
- Starboard range: 170° to 185°
- Port range: 260° to 275°
- Average: 177.5° starboard, 267.5° port (90° tack angle)
- Pattern: 10-12 minute cycles

**In-Race Compass Usage:**

**For Starboard Tack (lower numbers = lifted):**
- Record average: e.g., 180°
- If reading 170°: LIFTED → keep sailing
- If reading 190°: HEADED → tack soon
- **New high**: If reading 195° (beyond previous range) = persistent shift, stay high

**For Port Tack (higher numbers = headed):**
- Record average: e.g., 265°
- If reading 275°: LIFTED → keep sailing
- If reading 255°: HEADED → tack soon
- **Remember**: "Port, Higher, Header"

**Callout Protocol:**
- Tactician: "Compass please"
- Helmsman: "One-seven-five" (175°)
- Tactician: "Five degrees left, headed, prepare to tack"

**Decision Trigger**:
- Tack when 5-7° headed from average (oscillating winds)
- Sail 5-7° beyond previous range if new persistent shift
- Use 3-data-point rule before committing to persistent shift

### 4. Strategic Side Selection

**Which Side is Favored? (Pre-Race Testing)**

**Method 1: Local Knowledge**
- Historical patterns for venue
- Time of day effects
- Sea breeze vs. gradient wind timing
- Geographic channeling effects

**Method 2: Single-Boat Testing**
- Sail to each side of course pre-start
- Test for pressure differences
- Look for consistent shift direction
- Note velocity headers/lifts

**Method 3: Two-Boat Testing**
- Each boat sails opposite sides for set time (3-5 minutes)
- Tack back toward center
- Compare positions at crossing
- More ahead = favored side

**Method 4: Fleet Observation**
- Watch early starters or other classes
- Note which side pays
- Observe pressure patterns on water
- Track leaders' choices

**Decision Framework:**
```
IF persistent right shift expected → favor right side (70% commitment)
IF persistent left shift expected → favor left side (70% commitment)
IF oscillating conditions → favor middle (60% middle, 20% each side)
IF pressure differential → favor pressure side (80% commitment)
IF uncertain → play middle (40% middle, 30% each side)
```

### 5. Risk Management: Corners vs. Middle

**Play the Middle When:**
- Uncertain wind pattern
- First race of series
- Unfamiliar venue
- Mixed fleet (want to cover)
- Oscillating conditions
- Currently in top 25% of fleet

**Advantages of Middle:**
- Preserves options
- Limits losses
- Allows recovery from errors
- Enables tactical covering
- Provides visibility of both sides

**Go to Corners When:**
- High confidence in wind pattern
- Must-win situation (behind in series)
- Clear pressure or shift advantage
- Small fleet (lower risk)
- Familiar venue with reliable patterns

**How Far to Commit:**
- **Conservative**: Stay within middle 60% of course
- **Moderate**: Use middle 80% of course
- **Aggressive**: Use full course width but avoid extreme 10% at corners
- **Only commit to extreme corners** (outer 10%) when confident AND must-win

**Decision Trigger**: Only go to the outer 25% of course when:
1. You have 70%+ confidence in wind advantage
2. AND you must gain positions (or defending lead)
3. AND you're willing to accept 2× risk if wrong

### 6. Caught on Wrong Side: Recovery Strategies

**When to Bail Out:**
- Clear evidence you're on wrong side (compass shows persistent shift away)
- Fleet majority on opposite side is extending
- Lost 2+ positions due to side selection
- Halfway up beat and still losing

**When to Commit:**
- Wind pattern still unclear
- Less than 1/3 up the beat
- Only 1-2 boats ahead on other side
- Your testing showed this side favored

**Damage Control Tactics:**
- **Don't overcommit to begin with**: Use 70% commitment max
- **Hedge your bets**: When in doubt, stay with pack
- **Be realistic**: Don't fool yourself about what's happening
- **While deciding**: Sail toward middle, NOT further to corner
- **Cut losses early**: Better to bail at 1/3 mark than 2/3 mark

**Decision Framework:**
```
IF wrong side AND < 1/3 up beat → Bail out, cut losses
IF wrong side AND 1/3 to 1/2 up beat → Evaluate: can pattern reverse?
IF wrong side AND > 1/2 up beat → Commit to corner, hope for reversal
IF uncertain → Sail toward middle while gathering more data
```

**Surprising Fact**: Sailors who bail out halfway often finish closer to leaders than those who committed to wrong side. Don't be stubborn.

### 7. Strategy in Different Wind Speeds

**Light Air (<8 knots):**
- **Priorities**: Pressure > Geography > Shifts
- **Characteristics**: Large pressure differentials, less predictable shifts
- **Strategy**: Aggressively hunt pressure, accept tactical risks
- **Tacking**: Minimize tacks (expensive in light air)
- **Rule**: "Sail to the wind you want, not the wind you have"

**Medium Air (8-15 knots):**
- **Priorities**: Shifts > Pressure > Geography
- **Characteristics**: Most predictable, clean patterns
- **Strategy**: Classic upwind strategy applies
- **Tacking**: Tack freely on headers
- **Rule**: "Stay in phase with oscillations"

**Heavy Air (15+ knots):**
- **Priorities**: Boatspeed > Shifts > Pressure
- **Characteristics**: Puffy, harder to identify patterns
- **Strategy**: Conservative, fewer tacks, stay with fleet
- **Tacking**: Costly (speed loss), tack on big shifts only
- **Rule**: "Boat speed first, strategy second"

**Decision Trigger**:
- Light air: Chase 2+ knot pressure difference even if wrong direction
- Medium air: Tack on 5° headers
- Heavy air: Tack only on 10°+ headers or tactical necessity

### 8. Positional Strategy: Leading vs. Trailing

**When Leading:**
- **Primary goal**: Protect lead, don't take unnecessary risk
- **Strategy**: Cover fleet loosely, stay near middle
- **Tactic**: "Stay between fleet and mark"
- **Risk tolerance**: 20% (conservative)
- **Shift response**: Match fleet's moves with slight delay

**When in Pack (Top 50%):**
- **Primary goal**: Consistent execution, minimize errors
- **Strategy**: Play percentages, follow wind pattern
- **Tactic**: "Sail your own race, watch top 3"
- **Risk tolerance**: 50% (moderate)
- **Shift response**: Tack on headers per compass plan

**When Trailing (Bottom 50%):**
- **Primary goal**: Gain positions, accept calculated risk
- **Strategy**: Split from fleet, hunt advantages
- **Tactic**: "Opposite of leaders when reasonable"
- **Risk tolerance**: 70% (aggressive)
- **Shift response**: Commit to sides early, hope for shift

**When Far Behind (Must-Catch-Up):**
- **Primary goal**: Maximum gain potential
- **Strategy**: Extreme splits, all-or-nothing sides
- **Tactic**: "Go where they're not"
- **Risk tolerance**: 90% (very aggressive)
- **Shift response**: Full commitment to corners

### 9. Integration with Tactical Layer

**Strategy vs. Tactics Priority:**
- **Strategy**: Where on course to position (big picture, long-term)
- **Tactics**: How to handle nearby boats (micro-level, short-term)
- **Priority rule**: "Strategy first, tactics second"

**When to Prioritize Tactics Over Strategy:**
- Last 25% of beat (near laylines)
- Direct duel with key competitor
- Immediate threat to position (being covered or lee-bowed)
- Mark approach situation

**When to Prioritize Strategy Over Tactics:**
- First 50% of beat
- Fleet race (not match race)
- Strong conviction about wind pattern
- Leading and protecting

**Decision Trigger**: If tactical situation will cost <5% of leg distance, prioritize strategy. If tactical situation will cost >5% of leg distance, address tactics first, then return to strategy.
