# Slack Window Planner Skill

This Claude Skill generates maneuver schedules that revolve around tidal slack, high, and low windows.

- Consumes RegattaFlow's slack timeline, race plan, and tidal intel.  
- Prioritizes risky crossings and mark approaches during neutral current.  
- Flags timing conflicts and recommends fallback sequences when slack uncertainty is high.
