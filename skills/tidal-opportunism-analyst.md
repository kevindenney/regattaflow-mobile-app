# Tidal Opportunism Analyst Skill

This Claude Skill teaches the model how to turn RegattaFlow's bathymetry, WorldTides Pro intelligence, and strategic feature detection into opportunistic racing moves.

- Differentiates tide height from current set and accounts for turn delays.  
- Highlights shoreline relief, eddies, and acceleration lanes using depth gradients.  
- Plans anchoring and slack-window maneuvers when foul current overwhelms VMG.  
- Produces JSON output with actionable maneuvers, anchoring protocol, relief lanes, and caveats.
