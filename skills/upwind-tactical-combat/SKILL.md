# Upwind Tactical Combat

## Description
Master boat-on-boat tactical confrontations through covering techniques, leverage calculations, tacking duels, and position defense. Execute tactical weapons effectively while maintaining strategic objectives and understanding gain/loss mathematics.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Leverage and Gain/Loss Mathematics

**Understanding Leverage:**
- **Leverage** = lateral separation between boats
- More leverage = more gain/loss in shifts
- Leverage builds quickly when boats split tacks
- At 6 knots, 60 seconds of splitting = 848 feet of leverage

**Quantifiable Gains (10° shift):**

**Same Tack, Lateral Split:**
- Gain = 25% of lateral separation
- 100 yards separation = 25 yards gain/loss
- 848 feet separation (60 sec at 6 knots) = 212 feet gain/loss (21 seconds)

**One Boat Ahead:**
- **Boat toward shift** (leverage = distance behind): Gains 19%
- **Boat away from shift** (leverage = distance behind): Loses 16%
- **Boat straight downwind** (no leverage): Gains 2%
- **To pull even**: Need 5.7× leverage in 10° shift

**Decision Mathematics:**
```
IF you're behind by 100 feet
AND you have 570 feet of leverage toward expected shift
THEN a 10° shift pulls you even
BUT a 10° shift the other way puts you 200 feet behind
```

**Risk Assessment Formula:**
- **Time splitting** ÷ 3 = Approximate gain/loss time in 10° shift
- 60 seconds splitting = ±20 second gain/loss potential
- 120 seconds splitting = ±40 second gain/loss potential

**Decision Trigger**:
- When ahead: Avoid giving >100 feet leverage if shift uncertainty >50%
- When behind: Accept 5:1 leverage ratio if shift confidence >60%

### 2. Covering: When and How

**Loose Cover (Preferred When Leading):**
- **Position**: Stay within 45° arc between trailing boat and mark
- **Distance**: 3-8 boat lengths lateral separation
- **Purpose**: Control without taking same risks
- **Benefit**: If you're wrong about shift, you don't lose as much

**Execution:**
- Tack when trailer tacks (with slight delay)
- Stay on lifted tack longer if strategic
- Don't match every move, just stay between them and mark
- Maintain visibility of covered boat

**Tight Cover (Use Sparingly):**
- **Position**: Directly ahead, on same layline
- **Distance**: 1-3 boat lengths separation
- **Purpose**: Lock down specific competitor
- **Risk**: Takes same shift risks as trailer

**Execution:**
- Tack immediately when they tack
- Match their moves exactly
- Use bad air to slow them
- Maintain control position

**When to Cover Tightly:**
- Match race situations
- Last beat of race when leading
- Covering specific series rival
- Near laylines (last 25% of beat)

**When to Cover Loosely:**
- Fleet race with multiple threats
- First half of beat
- Uncertain wind conditions
- When your strategy differs from theirs

**When NOT to Cover:**
- You're not actually ahead (lateral separation misleads)
- It takes you away from strategic side
- Other boats are bigger threat
- Wind is very shifty (you'll tack too much)

**Decision Trigger**:
```
IF leading AND first 50% of beat → Loose cover (4-8 lengths)
IF leading AND last 25% of beat → Tight cover (1-3 lengths)
IF leading by <100 feet AND they tack → Cover within 2 tacks
IF leading by >500 feet AND they tack → Evaluate strategic merit first
```

### 3. Splitting: When to Go Opposite

**Split When Behind and:**
- You have strong conviction about favored side (70%+ confidence)
- Leaders are going wrong way strategically
- You must gain positions (trailing in series)
- Different wind on your side of course
- Pressure differential exists

**Don't Split When:**
- You're ahead (cover instead)
- Uncertain about wind pattern (<50% confidence)
- Near laylines
- Match race scenario
- First race of series (need data)

**How Much to Split:**
- **Conservative split**: 100-200 feet lateral (20-30 seconds of sailing)
- **Moderate split**: 300-500 feet lateral (60-90 seconds of sailing)
- **Aggressive split**: 500+ feet lateral (120+ seconds of sailing)

**Split Decision Matrix:**
```
Position | Confidence | Split Amount | Risk Level
---------|-----------|--------------|------------
Leading  | Any       | Don't split  | N/A
Top 3    | >80%      | Conservative | Low
Mid-pack | >70%      | Moderate     | Medium
Trailing | >60%      | Aggressive   | High
Last 25% | >90%      | Conservative | Medium
```

**Managing the Split:**
- Track compass readings from both sides
- Watch for pressure differences
- Note fleet movement patterns
- Have bailout plan (when to cut losses)
- Don't overcommit past 2/3 of beat

**Decision Trigger**:
- If split isn't working after 1/3 of beat, bail out
- If gaining ground, commit through 1/2 mark
- If losing >3 positions, cut losses immediately

### 4. Tacking Duels: Offense and Defense

**Offensive Tactics (When Behind):**

**Safe Leeward Position:**
- Cross ahead and tack on their lee bow
- **Distance**: 2-4 boat lengths ahead
- **Effect**: Forces them to tack or sail in bad air
- **Counter**: They may tack immediately (be ready)

**Slam Dunk:**
- Tack directly on their bow (aggressive)
- **Distance**: 1-2 boat lengths (close)
- **Effect**: Forces immediate tack or they sail into your bad air
- **Risk**: If too close, you're fouling out

**Covering Tack:**
- When ahead, tack on their air after they tack
- **Timing**: Tack 2-5 seconds after they complete tack
- **Effect**: Puts you in controlling position
- **Purpose**: Maintain or extend lead

**Decision Triggers:**
```
IF you cross ahead by 3+ lengths → Safe leeward position
IF you cross ahead by 1-2 lengths → Slam dunk (aggressive)
IF you cross behind by 1-2 lengths → Duck, accelerate, tack when clear
IF you cross behind by 3+ lengths → Duck and split
```

**Defensive Tactics (When Ahead):**

**Tack Away Early:**
- When opponent approaching on port
- Tack before they arrive (5-10 lengths)
- **Purpose**: Avoid confrontation, maintain control
- **Benefit**: They can't lee bow you

**Double Tack:**
- Let them tack on your lee bow
- Immediately tack back over them
- **Effect**: You end up ahead on their original side
- **Works when**: You have speed advantage

**Pinch and Extend:**
- When lee-bowed, pinch above their wind shadow
- Slowly pull ahead using height advantage
- **Works when**: You have superior pointing ability
- **Patience required**: Takes 30-60 seconds

**Tack to Cover:**
- Match their tack to maintain controlling position
- **Timing**: Tack 3-5 seconds after they settle
- **Purpose**: Stay between them and mark

**Decision Triggers:**
```
IF they're 10+ lengths away approaching on port → Tack away early
IF they tack on your lee bow AND you're faster → Double tack
IF they tack on your lee bow AND equal speed → Pinch and extend
IF they tack away AND you want to cover → Tack within 5 seconds
```

### 5. Defending Against Lee Bow

**Immediate Recognition:**
- Watch for boats crossing ahead by 1-4 lengths
- Anticipate their lee bow tack
- Be ready with counter-move

**Defense Options (in order of preference):**

**1. Tack Away Before They Tack:**
- **Best option**: Avoids confrontation entirely
- **Timing**: Tack when they're 3-5 lengths away
- **Works**: 90% of time if you have room

**2. Drive Through to Windward:**
- Keep speed up, drive over them
- Use momentum to get to windward position
- **Works when**: You have speed advantage or they're too far ahead
- **Time limit**: Must succeed within 30-45 seconds

**3. Immediate Tack (Double Tack):**
- As soon as they complete tack, you tack
- End up ahead on the other tack
- **Works when**: You have clear lane on other tack
- **Risk**: If no lane, you're trapped

**4. Pinch Above Their Bad Air:**
- Sail high of their wind shadow
- Slowly work to weather
- **Works when**: You point higher
- **Patience**: Can take 60-90 seconds
- **Watch for**: Further lee bows from others

**5. Duck and Restart:**
- Bear off behind them
- Build speed and split
- **Last resort**: When other options blocked
- **Advantage**: Gets you clear air and new opportunity

**Decision Framework:**
```
IF they're crossing 4+ lengths ahead → Let them go, no action
IF they're crossing 2-3 lengths ahead → Prepare tack away
IF they're crossing 1-2 lengths ahead → Tack before they do
IF they've already lee-bowed you → Assess: speed advantage?
  IF yes → Drive through to windward
  IF no → Immediate tack away
  IF no room to tack → Pinch or duck
```

### 6. Tactical Principles: Leading vs. Trailing

**When Leading (Top 3 Positions):**

**Primary Principle**: "Stay between competition and mark"
- Loose cover on main threats
- Don't take unnecessary risks
- Match fleet's tactical moves with delay
- Prioritize position retention over gains

**Tactical Rules:**
- Cover boats within 200 feet loosely
- Let boats >500 feet go their way
- Tack on headers to avoid being passed
- Avoid extremes (stay middle 60% of course)
- Don't initiate tacking duels

**Risk Tolerance**: 20% (conservative)

**Decision Trigger**: If covering takes you to unfavored side, maintain loose cover (45° arc) but don't match tack-for-tack.

**When in Pack (4th-50th percentile):**

**Primary Principle**: "Sail your own race, watch the leaders"
- Follow strategic plan
- Use tactics to improve position opportunistically
- Don't get dragged into tacking duels
- Stay in phase with wind

**Tactical Rules:**
- Tack on headers per strategy
- Take safe leeward when opportunity arises
- Avoid high-risk duels with mid-pack boats
- Watch top 3 for strategic clues
- Use clear air lanes

**Risk Tolerance**: 50% (moderate)

**Decision Trigger**: Only engage tactically with boats within ±2 positions. Ignore boats >5 positions different.

**When Trailing (Bottom 50%):**

**Primary Principle**: "Go opposite of the leaders when reasonable"
- Split from fleet to find advantages
- Take calculated tactical risks
- Hunt for pressure/shifts leaders miss
- Accept confrontation to gain lanes

**Tactical Rules:**
- Split early and often (if strategic)
- Lee bow aggressively when crossing ahead
- Defend clear air aggressively
- Commit to corners if conviction exists
- Don't cover anyone (focus on gaining)

**Risk Tolerance**: 70% (aggressive)

**Decision Trigger**: If split isn't working after 1/3 beat, try opposite side. If that fails, sail for clear air and boatspeed.

### 7. Tactical Weapons Inventory

**Safe Leeward:**
- **Setup**: Cross ahead by 2-4 lengths, tack
- **Effect**: Forces opponent to tack or lose
- **Counter**: Opponent tacks immediately
- **Use**: When ahead tactically, want to control

**Slam Dunk:**
- **Setup**: Cross ahead by 1-2 lengths, tack close
- **Effect**: Forces immediate tack
- **Counter**: Protest or luff
- **Use**: Aggressive covering, match racing

**Loose Cover:**
- **Setup**: Stay 45° arc between opponent and mark
- **Effect**: Controls without taking same risks
- **Counter**: Large split forces decision
- **Use**: Fleet racing when ahead

**Tight Cover:**
- **Setup**: Stay directly ahead, 1-3 lengths
- **Effect**: Locks down opponent
- **Counter**: Opponent accepts and tries to out-point
- **Use**: Match racing, last beat

**Tack to Leeward:**
- **Setup**: Approaching on opposite tack, tack on their leeward bow
- **Effect**: Gains immediate lane, forces them up
- **Counter**: They drive through to windward
- **Use**: Creating lane in crowded situation

**Fake Tack:**
- **Setup**: Begin tack, abort, continue on same tack
- **Effect**: Opponent may tack, giving you advantage
- **Counter**: Don't follow unless strategic
- **Use**: Advanced tactic, use sparingly

**Decision Matrix for Weapon Selection:**
```
Situation                    | Weapon             | Success Rate
----------------------------|-------------------|-------------
Cross ahead 3+ lengths      | Safe leeward      | 80%
Cross ahead 1-2 lengths     | Slam dunk         | 60%
Leading by 100-300 feet     | Loose cover       | 70%
Match race, leading         | Tight cover       | 85%
Need lane in traffic        | Tack to leeward   | 65%
Opponent reactive           | Fake tack         | 40%
```

### 8. Rules Knowledge for Tactics

**Critical Upwind Rules:**

**Tacking Too Close (Rule 13):**
- You must give room when tacking near another boat
- If they have to alter course immediately, you're too close
- **Penalty**: You must take penalty turns
- **Safe distance**: 2+ boat lengths when tacking on lee bow

**Port/Starboard (Rule 10):**
- Starboard tack has right of way over port
- Port must keep clear
- **Use tactically**: Approach on starboard for advantage
- **Defend**: Tack to starboard when port approaches

**Same Tack Windward/Leeward (Rule 11):**
- Windward boat must keep clear
- Leeward boat can luff up slowly (before beam-to-beam)
- **Use tactically**: Establish leeward position for rights
- **Defend**: Don't let boats establish leeward overlap

**Tacking in Zone (Rule 13 + 18):**
- Can't tack within 2 lengths of mark if it forces others to change course
- Plan laylines accordingly
- **Avoid**: Tacking in the zone in traffic

**Decision Trigger**: When executing tactical maneuver, ensure 2+ boat length separation to avoid protests. In competitive fleet, assume aggressive competitors will push rules limits.

### 9. Reading Opponents

**Identify Boat Types:**

**Aggressive Tactician:**
- Initiates tacking duels
- Takes risks for position
- **Counter**: Stay calm, force them into bad positions
- **Exploit**: Let them overcommit, then capitalize

**Conservative Sailor:**
- Avoids confrontation
- Sails own race
- **Counter**: Apply pressure, they may crack
- **Exploit**: Lee bow them, they'll tack away

**Fast Boat:**
- Superior speed, tries to drive through
- **Counter**: Maintain tactical control, don't let them build speed
- **Exploit**: Force tacks, kill their speed advantage

**Tactical Expert:**
- Knows all the moves
- Stays cool under pressure
- **Counter**: Play strategic game, avoid tactical battles
- **Exploit**: Rare - respect and sail your own race

**Decision Trigger**: Within first 3-5 minutes upwind, identify opponent type. Adjust tactical approach accordingly.

### 10. Transitioning from Tactics to Strategy

**When to Abandon Tactical Battle:**
- Reaching layline (last 25% of beat)
- Wind shift makes strategic side critical
- Other competitors passing both of you
- Duel has gone >5 minutes with no advantage

**Transition Indicators:**
```
IF engaged in tacking duel for 3+ minutes
AND neither boat has gained >2 lengths
AND strategic side is clearly favored
THEN bail out tactically, execute strategic plan
```

**Re-establishing Strategy:**
1. **Disengage**: Commit to one tack for 2+ minutes
2. **Assess position**: Check compass, laylines, fleet
3. **Reset priorities**: Strategy > tactics
4. **Execute**: Sail to strategic side with minimal tacking

**Decision Trigger**: If tactical battle costs >10% of leg in lost distance to mark, abandon tactics and execute strategy.

## Practice Drills

1. **Leverage drill**: Practice calculating lateral separation and estimating gain/loss
2. **Covering drill**: Practice loose vs. tight covering with partner boat
3. **Lee bow drill**: Practice safe leeward positioning at various crossing distances
4. **Defense drill**: Practice defending against lee bow attempts
5. **Tacking drill**: Practice clean tacks under pressure (minimize speed loss)

## Expected Outcomes

- **Immediate**: Clean execution of safe leeward and basic covering
- **Short-term**: Confident tactical decision-making, 60% success in duels
- **Long-term**: Advanced tactical weapons mastery, strategic/tactical balance
- **Elite**: Reading opponents accurately, winning 70%+ of tactical confrontations
