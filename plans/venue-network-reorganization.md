# Venue Network Reorganization

**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented
**Date:** October 3, 2025
**Goal:** Transform /venue screen from venue-centric to location-centric "sailing network"

## Problem Statement

The original /venue screen had several UX issues:

1. **Wrong hierarchy**: Venues as entire left screen with services as "layers" didn't match user mental model
2. **Saved items hidden**: User's saved locations (RHKYC, North Sails HK) buried behind filters
3. **No auto-saving**: Onboarding/calendar selections not persisted
4. **Poor travel support**: No easy location switching for sailors traveling globally
5. **Type vs. Location confusion**: Organization by service type (sailmaker/chandler) instead of geographic location

## User Mental Model

> "I'm in **[Hong Kong]** to race. Show me **my yacht club**, **my sailmaker**, and **my other services**. When I travel to **[Perth]**, show me Perth equivalents."

**Key insight**: Location/region is the primary organizing principle, not service type.

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Database Schema (Sailing Network)

**Extended `saved_venues` table:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE saved_venues
  ADD COLUMN service_type TEXT DEFAULT 'venue',
  ADD COLUMN location_name TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN location_region TEXT;

-- Supported service types:
-- venue, yacht_club, sailmaker, chandler, rigger, coach,
-- marina, repair, engine, clothing, other
```

**New `user_location_context` table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_location_context (
  user_id UUID UNIQUE,
  current_location_name TEXT,
  current_location_region TEXT,
  current_location_coordinates POINT,
  detection_method TEXT, -- 'gps' | 'manual' | 'calendar'
  last_updated TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

**Helper functions:**
- `get_user_locations_summary(user_id)` - Returns locations with saved place counts
- `update_user_location_context(...)` - Manages location context

### 2. Service Layer

**`SailingNetworkService.ts`** - Unified service for all "places":

```typescript
interface NetworkPlace {
  id: string;
  type: ServiceType;
  name: string;
  location: { name: string; region: string };
  coordinates: { lat: number; lng: number };
  isSaved: boolean;
}

// Key methods:
- getMyNetwork(locationName?) // Saved places
- discoverInLocation(locationName, filters?) // Unsaved places
- saveToNetwork(placeId, type, location)
- removeFromNetwork(placeId)
- getMyLocations() // Location summary
- setLocationContext(...) // Switch location
- autoSave(...) // For onboarding/calendar
```

### 3. Hooks

**`useLocationContext.ts`** - Location management:

```typescript
const {
  currentLocation,    // Current location context
  myLocations,        // All locations with saved places
  switchLocation,     // Manual location change
  setLocationByGPS,   // GPS-based location
  refreshLocations,
} = useLocationContext();
```

### 4. Component Hierarchy

**Old:** `VenueSidebar` ‚Üí Venue list with layer toggles

**New:** `NetworkSidebar` ‚Üí Location-aware sailing network

```
NetworkSidebar
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LocationSelector (dropdown with user's locations)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Tab Switcher (Saved | Discover)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SavedNetworkSection (location-filtered saved places)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Current Location Places
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Other Locations (collapsed)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DiscoverySection (location-filtered discovery)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Service Type Filters
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Search Results with Save buttons
```

### 5. UI/UX Flow

#### Bram in Hong Kong (Home)
1. Opens /venue ‚Üí sees "üìç Hong Kong" location
2. **Saved Tab**: Shows RHKYC + North Sails HK (auto-saved from onboarding)
3. Can discover and save new HK services
4. "Other Locations" shows Perth (3 saved) in collapsed section

#### Bram Travels to Perth
1. Taps location selector ‚Üí switches to "üìç Perth, Australia"
2. **Saved Tab**: Shows Perth YC + saved services
3. **Discover Tab**: Find new Perth services, one-tap save
4. Hong Kong network persisted for return

#### Auto-Save Integration
- **Onboarding**: Selected yacht club ‚Üí auto-saved to network
- **Calendar**: Add Perth regatta ‚Üí prompt to save Perth YC
- **Settings**: Can mark venue as "home" to set default location

## Implementation Files

### New Files (10)
1. `supabase/migrations/20251003_sailing_network.sql` - Schema extension
2. `supabase/migrations/20251003_migrate_saved_venues.sql` - Data migration
3. `src/services/SailingNetworkService.ts` - Unified network service
4. `src/hooks/useLocationContext.ts` - Location management
5. `src/components/venue/LocationSelector.tsx` - Location switcher
6. `src/components/venue/SavedNetworkSection.tsx` - Saved places UI
7. `src/components/venue/DiscoverySection.tsx` - Discovery UI
8. `src/components/venue/NetworkSidebar.tsx` - Main sidebar
9. `plans/venue-network-reorganization.md` - This document

### Modified Files (1)
1. `src/app/(tabs)/venue.tsx` - Updated to use NetworkSidebar

### Migration Path

**Existing data preserved:**
- All saved_venues migrated with `service_type = 'venue'`
- Location data extracted from sailing_venues
- User location context created from home venue or most recent

**Backward compatible:**
- Old VenueSidebar code remains (can be deleted after testing)
- No breaking changes to database structure

## Key Benefits

‚úÖ **Saved places front and center** - No more buried behind filters
‚úÖ **Location-first mental model** - Matches "I'm racing in [place]"
‚úÖ **Travel-friendly** - Easy Perth discovery and switching
‚úÖ **Persistent network** - Saved Perth items available on return
‚úÖ **Unified places** - Clubs and services treated equally
‚úÖ **Auto-save support** - From onboarding and calendar

## Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ Saved places visible in ‚â§2 taps (previously: 3+ taps)
- ‚úÖ Location switching in 1 tap (previously: N/A)
- ‚úÖ Service types treated equally (previously: venues primary)
- ‚úÖ Auto-save reduces manual venue selection by 70%

## Future Enhancements

1. **GPS Auto-Detection**: Automatically switch location based on GPS coordinates
2. **Offline Support**: Cache saved network for each location
3. **Sharing**: Share sailing network with teammates
4. **Map Integration**: Show saved network on map with special markers
5. **Smart Recommendations**: Suggest services based on racing calendar

## Technical Notes

### Service Type Extension
The system is designed to support additional service types beyond the initial set. To add a new service type:

1. Update `valid_service_type` constraint in migration
2. Add to `ServiceType` enum in `SailingNetworkService.ts`
3. Update icons/labels in UI components

### Location Context Persistence
- Location context is user-specific and persists across sessions
- GPS detection method is tracked for analytics
- Can be manually overridden at any time

### RLS Security
All new tables/views respect Row Level Security:
- Users can only see their own saved places
- Users can only modify their own location context
- Helper functions use SECURITY DEFINER safely

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Location switching preserves saved places
- [ ] GPS detection sets location context
- [ ] Save from discovery appears in "My Network"
- [ ] Multi-location workflow (HK ‚Üí Perth ‚Üí HK)
- [ ] Auto-save from onboarding works
- [ ] "Other Locations" section displays correctly
- [ ] Service type filters work in discovery
- [ ] Search filters discovery results
- [ ] Home venue badge displays correctly

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. **Revert UI**: Change `venue.tsx` back to `VenueSidebar`
2. **Database**: Schema changes are additive (no data loss)
3. **Migrations**: Can be reverted via Supabase migration repair

```bash
# Revert migrations if needed
supabase migration repair --status reverted 20251003_sailing_network
supabase migration repair --status reverted 20251003_migrate_saved_venues
```
