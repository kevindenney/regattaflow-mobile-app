# Multi-User Authentication & Role-Based Dashboard System
*Living Document - Last Updated: September 27, 2025*

## Overview
Comprehensive authentication system that recognizes three user types (Sailor, Club, Coach) at signup and routes them to specialized dashboards with role-specific features, creating a unified sailing ecosystem.

## Project Context
RegattaFlow transforms the fragmented sailing world into a unified platform where sailors get AI-powered race strategy, clubs manage events professionally, and coaches monetize their expertise through an integrated marketplace.

## User Type Definitions

### 1. Sailor Profile
**Primary Persona: Bram Van Olsen**
- Dragon class sailor, Hong Kong-based, international competitor
- Needs: Race strategy, equipment tracking, venue intelligence, coach access
- Journey: Sign up → Select boats/equipment → View upcoming races → Get AI strategy → Track performance

### 2. Club Profile
**Primary Persona: Sarah Liu - RHKYC Sailing Manager**
- Professional race management, event coordination, results publication
- Needs: Event creation, race committee tools, member management, protest handling
- Journey: Sign up → Set up venues → Create events → Manage race day → Publish results

### 3. Coach Profile
**Primary Persona: Mike Thompson - 2x Dragon World Champion**
- Professional coaching services, performance analysis, client management
- Needs: Client dashboard, session booking, marketplace presence, performance tools
- Journey: Sign up → Create profile → Set expertise → Manage clients → Analyze performance

### Authentication Flow Enhancement

#### Updated AuthContext Structure
```typescript
interface AuthContextType {
  // Existing
  user: User | null;
  session: Session | null;
  userProfile: UserProfile | null;
  loading: boolean;

  // New role-based additions
  userType: 'sailor' | 'club' | 'coach' | null;
  specificProfile: SailorProfile | ClubProfile | CoachProfile | null;
  permissions: UserPermission[];
  onboardingCompleted: boolean;

  // Enhanced methods
  signUp: (email: string, password: string, fullName: string, userType: UserType) => Promise<void>;
  completeOnboarding: (profileData: any) => Promise<void>;
  switchRole: (newRole: UserType) => Promise<void>; // For users with multiple roles
}
```

#### Enhanced Signup Process
```typescript
// app/(auth)/signup.tsx enhancements
interface SignupFormData {
  email: string;
  password: string;
  fullName: string;
  userType: 'sailor' | 'club' | 'coach';

  // Conditional fields based on user type
  sailor?: {
    experienceLevel: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Role Complexity**: Multiple user types increase development complexity
   - *Mitigation*: Shared component library and consistent patterns

2. **Mobile Performance**: Race day features must work reliably on water
   - *Mitigation*: Offline-first architecture and extensive testing

3. **Real-time Features**: Live race tracking and timing critical for clubs
   - *Mitigation*: Redundant systems and fallback mechanisms

### Business Risks
1. **User Type Confusion**: Users might not understand role differences
   - *Mitigation*: Clear onboarding and role-specific marketing

2. **Market Adoption**: Each user type has different adoption curves
   - *Mitigation*: Staged rollout focusing on sailors first

3. **Feature Complexity**: Too many features might overwhelm users
   - *Mitigation*: Progressive disclosure and role-based feature sets

### Operational Risks
1. **Support Complexity**: Different user types need different support
   - *Mitigation*: Role-specific documentation and support workflows

2. **Data Privacy**: Multiple user types sharing data increases privacy risks
   - *Mitigation*: Granular permissions and clear data sharing policies

## Testing Strategy

### User Type Testing
- **Role-based Authentication**: Verify each user type can only access appropriate features
- **Cross-role Interactions**: Test sailor-coach, sailor-club, and club-coach interactions
- **Onboarding Flows**: Ensure each user type onboarding completes successfully

### Mobile Testing
- **Race Day Scenarios**: Test all race day features in offline conditions
- **GPS Accuracy**: Verify race tracking accuracy across different devices
- **Performance**: Ensure mobile features work under poor network conditions

### Integration Testing
- **External Systems**: Test polling and integration with racing results websites
- **Payment Processing**: Verify coaching payments and club event fees
- **Real-time Features**: Test live race tracking and results publication

## Documentation Requirements

### User Documentation
- **Sailor Guide**: Complete guide to race strategy and equipment tracking
- **Club Manual**: Event management and race committee procedures
- **Coach Handbook**: Client management and marketplace best practices

### Technical Documentation
- **API Documentation**: Role-based API access and permissions
- **Database Schema**: Complete multi-user data model documentation
- **Deployment Guide**: Role-specific deployment and configuration

### Support Documentation
- **Troubleshooting**: Role-specific common issues and solutions
- **Feature Guides**: Detailed guides for complex features by user type
