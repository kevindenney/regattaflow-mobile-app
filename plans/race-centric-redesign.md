## Phase 1: Onboarding Simplification ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### Goals
- Remove barriers to entry
- Add owner/crew role selection
- Allow immediate dashboard access without next race data

### Tasks
- [x] 1.1 Update database schema - Add `sailor_role` field
- [x] 1.2 Remove next race requirement from onboarding validation
- [x] 1.3 Update onboarding chat prompts (remove race calendar)
- [x] 1.4 Update dashboard validation (allow empty race state)

### Files to Modify

  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sailor_role TEXT
  CHECK (sailor_role IN ('owner', 'crew', 'both'));

-- Remove next_race requirement from onboarding_completed logic
```
