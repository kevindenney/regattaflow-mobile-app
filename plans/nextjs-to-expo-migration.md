# Next.js to Expo Universal Migration Plan

*Last Updated: September 26, 2025 - Major Progress Update*

## ðŸŽ¯ MAJOR PROGRESS UPDATE - September 26, 2025

### âœ… COMPLETED MILESTONES:
1. **Expo Web Configuration** - Successfully configured for production web builds
2. **Dashboard Screen** - Complete user dashboard with stats, recent events, and quick actions
3. **Results Page** - Full regatta management with stats grid and regatta cards
4. **Marketing Homepage** - Professional landing page with responsive design
5. **Production Build System** - `expo export --platform web` working and tested
6. **Vercel Deployment** - Configuration ready for seamless deployment
7. **ðŸ”¥ WEB ROUTING FIXES** - MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Solved Expo Router directory mismatch
   - **Root Cause**: Routes were in `/app/` but Expo Router was looking in `/src/app/`
   - **Solution**: Created direct route components in correct `src/app/` location
   - **Result**: All routes now work: /dashboard, /map, /results, /documents, /profile
   - **Applied Systematic Debugging**: 7-point analysis â†’ Console logging â†’ Directory fix

### ðŸš€ CURRENT STATUS:
- **Web App**: Fully functional at localhost:8081 with all core features
- **Tab Navigation**: Dashboard, Map, Regattas, Results, Strategy, Documents, Profile
- **Authentication**: Working Supabase integration
- **Document Upload**: AI-powered document processing functional
- **Ready for Deployment**: Can deploy to Vercel immediately

### ðŸ“‹ REMAINING TASKS:
- Stripe payment integration enhancement
- Additional marketing pages (pricing, features, about)
- Final testing and optimization
